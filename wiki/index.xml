It is where most of our adventures take place. It is a world where the lands are broken and scattered over the skies, floating above the open expanse of the [[Great Blue]]. You&amp;rsquo;ll see [[Skyships]] flying over the clouds transporting cargo and people from one city to another, each built on the many floating islands and continents of the world.</description></item><item><title>History of the World</title><link>https://www.tabletopflore.com/wiki/history-of-halcyon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 20:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.tabletopflore.com/wiki/history-of-halcyon/</guid><description>The precise origin of [[Halcyon]] is clouded in mystery.

As much as I highly appreciate someone digging deeper into this world of my making, please make sure to keep player knowledge and character knowledge seperate. When in doubt, you can always ask me about it, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to help!</description></item><item><title>Flore's 5e House Rules</title><link>https://www.tabletopflore.com/wiki/flores-5e-house-rules/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 15:38:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.tabletopflore.com/wiki/flores-5e-house-rules/</guid><description>This article explains some of the homebrew rules, variant rules, and other important things to mention about how I personally run my Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 5th Edition games.
Alternative Resurrection Rules I use Matthew Mercer&amp;rsquo;s rules for resurrection, which is explained below.
