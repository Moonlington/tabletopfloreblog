&lt;p>The wiki will &lt;strong>never&lt;/strong> contain spoilers for any campaign or character backstory. It will only contain information to immerse yourself in the history of the setting and its people.&lt;/p>

&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#the-creation">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The origin of our world was a soup of primordial chaos, until from one unknown realm beyond the cosmos, the [[Prime Deities]] used their powers to stabilize a portion of the chaos, creating what would eventually be known as the [[Prime Material Plane]]. These deities were not fully formed, they were but young and ambitious forces in the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the world began to take its shape, life was formed as well. [[Elves]] were created first, and as they walked upon the green grass and looked out over the blue seas, the [[Prime Deities]] continued to tame the surrounding chaos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not long after the [[Elves|elves]], a second race was welcomed to the world: the [[Dwarves|dwarves]]. They were a race of community and a desire to, just like the [[Prime Deities]], tame a primordial world with their crafts and inventiveness. Next were a third race, both embodying chaos and order, the [[Human|humans]]. Their passion and unpredictability would bring meaning to the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After these three, the imagination of the gods became limitless, and even more creations came from the gods, but not even the mythic records in [[Aurora]] have a full record of the origin of the other children.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those that lived in this primal form of the world were struggling to live with the unpredictable and harsh environments, so as a mercy, the gods gave them a portion of their power in the form of [[Divine Magic]]. The Prime Deities also took their creation&amp;rsquo;s form upon themselves, and walked among the populace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the world was beginning to truly take shape, it gained the attention of beings from afar, [[Dragon|Dragons]]. Despite their hatred of the [[Prime Deities]], these beings migrated to the new world and carved their own place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The two moons were created in the image of one of the Prime Deities, [[Majora]] being the moon of elegance and beauty, and [[Minora]]&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-sundering" >The Sundering
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#the-sundering">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Slowly, some sense of order was created among the chaos of the universe, but this order did not come without strife. As the gods and their children poured their heart and soul into the world, the chaos surrounding and within the world only grew in anger and rage. It eventually culminated in an event called: &lt;em>the Sundering&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this event, primal beings spewed forth from the earth and from the cosmos in an attempt at retaking what was theirs. The gods fought and some even perished, resorting to arming their children with their final gift, the ability to create magic on their own, [[Arcane Magic]].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It fundamentally reshaped the land of the world, scattering its essence - its [[Aether]] - across the spectrum. What was once an enormous stretch of land only surrounded by water, became an uncountable amount of floating islands and continents, all flying above the unknowable depths of the [[Great Blue]].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only a tenth of the population survived, and it created a schism in the [[Prime Deities]] about their world. Some wanted to protect it with all of their power, some wanted to return it to its state of primordial chaos, as it was deemed a failure to them. This divide in the gods caused chaos and strife within, and eventually culminated in the imprisonment of those that sought to bring the world to chaos. They were imprisoned in worlds adjacent to the [[Prime Material Plane]], where they would be unable to influence the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-veiling" >The Veiling
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#the-veiling">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>As the world was now scattered and broken, most of the civilized had to be rebuilt. The first city of the world, [[Aurora]], stood the strongest. The [[Elves|elves]] that primarily inhabited it brought it back to its original glory, until the [[dwarves]], [[Gnome|gnomes]], and [[Human|humans]] that lived there invented technology and magic that would make use of the latent magical essence in the world. This was used in [[Skyship]] technology, a combination of using [[Arcane Magic]] and the natural [[Aether]] of the world to transport yourself through the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The world got its name [[Ae&amp;rsquo;thar]] from the elvish for &amp;ldquo;Air&amp;rdquo;. The use and study of [[Arcane Magic]] was the primary reason for this golden age of the world, it opened up many possibilities for everyone to harness magic, but it also exemplified the selfishness of those as well. One became so powerful she challenged the god of death itself, and won, taking his place, while others became so disillusioned with the gods that they thought themselves to be the true owners of the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This culminated in a chaotic war, like a &lt;em>second Sundering&lt;/em>. A war of [[Dragon]] versus man, gods versus gods, and man versus gods. Much of this age, the Age of Magic, has been lost to time, but its presence is ever so evident in the world we see today. Ruins and artifacts from this &lt;em>second Sundering&lt;/em> tell of unknown battles and stories during this Age. It&amp;rsquo;s speculated that only a fifth of the world population survived this event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This war was a turning point in how the Prime Deities looked upon the world. They created the [[Divine Veil]], barring the gods from materializing on the world, and they could only influence the world through their most devout followers.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>After the veiling of the world, each different portion of the world began their own history. Some turned towards the [[Prime Deities]], some turned to the [[Arcane Magic|arcane]], but every single nation starts their own new history, either starting anew, or built on top of the ruins of old.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Important Information</title><link>https://www.tabletopflore.com/wiki/important-information/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 15:38:56 +0200</pubDate><author>drmoonlington@gmail.com (Flore)</author><guid>https://www.tabletopflore.com/wiki/important-information/</guid><description>&lt;p>This wiki article explains some of the homebrew rules, variant rules, and other important things to mention about how I personally run my Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 5th Edition games.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I use Matthew Mercer&amp;rsquo;s rules for resurrection, which is explained below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Character death can often prove to become a minor inconvenience in some campaigns once the adventuring party reaches a certain level, with spells being available to return fallen comrades from the afterlife with temporary setbacks, robbing a small element of danger and threat to future conflicts and challenges within the story. If you wish to elevate the gravity of character death, you can introduce this optional rule.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If a character is dead, and a resurrection is attempted by a spell or spell effect with longer than a 1 action casting time, a Resurrection Challenge is initiated. Up to 3 members of the adventuring party can offer to contribute to the ritual via a Contribution Skill Check. The DM asks them each to make a skill check based on their form of contribution, with the DC of the check adjusting to how helpful/impactful the DM feels the contribution would be. For example, praying to the deity of the devout, fallen character may require an Intelligence (Religion) check at an easy to medium difficulty, where loudly demanding the soul of the fallen to return from the aether may require a Charisma (Intimidation) check at a very hard or nearly impossible difficulty. Advantage and disadvantage can apply here based on how perfect, or off base, the contribution offered is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After all contributions are completed, the DM then rolls a single, final Resurrection success check with no modifier. The base DC for the final resurrection check is 10, increasing by 1 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone (signifying the slow erosion of the soul’s connection to this world). For each successful contribution skill check, this DC is decreased by 3, whereas each failed contribution skill check increases the DC by 1. Upon a successful resurrection check, the player’s soul (should it be willing) will be returned to the body, and the ritual succeeded. On a failed check, the soul does not return and the character is lost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only the strongest of magical incantations can bypass this resurrection challenge, in the form of the True Resurrection or Wish spells. These spells can also restore a character to life who was lost due to a failed resurrection ritual.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If a spell with a casting time of 1 action is used to attempt to restore life (via the Revivify spell or similar effects), no contribution skill checks are allowed. The character casting the spell makes a Rapid Resurrection check, rolling a d20 and adding their spellcasting ability modifier. The DC is 10, increasing by 1 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone. On a failure, the character’s soul is not lost, but the resurrection fails and increases any future Resurrection checks’ DC by 1. No further attempts can be made to restore this character to life until a resurrection spell with a casting time higher than 1 action is attempted.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>There are a few races that are either overpowered or do not fit within the world of [[Ae&amp;rsquo;thar]]. These are as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Aarakocra (Flight is overpowered at lvl 1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Simic Hybrid (&amp;hellip;What even is it?)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedalken (Overpowered due to adv on saving throws)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yuan-ti Pureblood (Should be fine without Magic Resistance)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Variant Human (Given that I&amp;rsquo;m planning on giving everyone a free feat)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="bloodied-condition" >Bloodied Condition
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#bloodied-condition">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A character is bloodied when the character&amp;rsquo;s hit points are equal to or less then one-half the character&amp;rsquo;s maximum hit points, rounded down. One-half the character&amp;rsquo;s maximum hit points is referred to as the character&amp;rsquo;s bloodied value. For example: a character with 50 maximum hit points has a bloodied value of 25, and is bloodied whenever the character&amp;rsquo;s hit points are equal to or less than 25. Most of the time this will be used to communicate progress into defeating a monster and will have no impact on gameplay. Some monsters or homebrew classes might have features that activate whenever a character has the bloodied condition.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>If it makes sense for you to carry a thing, you can carry it. You won&amp;rsquo;t be able to carry whole statues, but I do not mind you having a lot of tiny stuff in your inventory.

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>If you roll a 20 on your attack roll against a creature, instead of either rolling twice the dice or double the amount, you add the maximum amount your dice could roll to your damage. Example: Your attack does 2d6+3 damage, on a crit you add 12 to that roll, which is the maximum of 2d6.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t like using XP for leveling because it encourages combat over the other pillars of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, exploration and social interaction.

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I like magic items to be a bit more special than normal. You can identify a magic item using the &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Identify&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; spell as usual, but you can only identify a magic item during a short rest if you succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC determined by the rarity of the magic item.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I also allow multiclassing, at least if you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>404 Page not found!</title><link>https://www.tabletopflore.com/wiki/404/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>drmoonlington@gmail.com (Flore)</author><guid>https://www.tabletopflore.com/wiki/404/</guid><description>&lt;p>Turns out I made a wikilink to something that I haven&amp;rsquo;t created a page for yet!&lt;/p>
