These deities were not fully formed, they were but young and ambitious forces in the universe.</p><p>As the world began to take its shape, life was formed as well. <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Elves</a> were created first, and as they walked upon the green grass and looked out over the blue seas, the <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Prime Deities</a> continued to tame the surrounding chaos.</p><p>Not long after the <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>elves</a>, a second race was welcomed to the world: the <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>dwarves</a>. They were a race of community and a desire to, just like the <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Prime Deities</a>, tame a primordial world with their crafts and inventiveness. Next were a third race, both embodying chaos and order, the <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>humans</a>. Their passion and unpredictability would bring meaning to the world.</p><p>After these three, the imagination of the gods became limitless, and even more creations came from the gods, but not even the mythic records in <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Aurora</a> have a full record of the origin of the other children.</p><p>Those that lived in this primal form of the world were struggling to live with the unpredictable and harsh environments, so as a mercy, the gods gave them a portion of their power in the form of <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Divine Magic</a>. The Prime Deities also took their creation&rsquo;s form upon themselves, and walked among the populace.</p><p>As the world was beginning to truly take shape, it gained the attention of beings from afar, <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Dragons</a>. Despite their hatred of the <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Prime Deities</a>, these beings migrated to the new world and carved their own place.</p><p>The two moons were created in the image of one of the Prime Deities, <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Majora</a> being the moon of elegance and beauty, and <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Minora</a>, the smaller slightly purple-hued moon of mystery and shadows.</p><h1 id=the-sundering>The Sundering

As the gods and their children poured their heart and soul into the world, the chaos surrounding and within the world only grew in anger and rage. It eventually culminated in an event called: <em>the Sundering</em>.</p><p>During this event, primal beings spewed forth from the earth and from the cosmos in an attempt at retaking what was theirs. The gods fought and some even perished, resorting to arming their children with their final gift, the ability to create magic on their own, <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Arcane Magic</a>.</p><p>It fundamentally reshaped the land of the world, scattering its essence - its <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Aether</a> - across the spectrum. What was once an enormous stretch of land only surrounded by water, became an uncountable amount of floating islands and continents, all flying above the unknowable depths of the <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Great Blue</a>.</p><p>Only a tenth of the population survived, and it created a schism in the <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Prime Deities</a> about their world. Some wanted to protect it with all of their power, some wanted to return it to its state of primordial chaos, as it was deemed a failure to them. This divide in the gods caused chaos and strife within, and eventually culminated in the imprisonment of those that sought to bring the world to chaos. They were imprisoned in worlds adjacent to the <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Prime Material Plane</a>, where they would be unable to influence the world.</p><h1 id=the-veiling>The Veiling

The first city of the world, <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Aurora</a>, stood the strongest. The <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>elves</a> that primarily inhabited it brought it back to its original glory, until the <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Dwarves</a>, <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>gnomes</a>, and <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>humans</a> that lived there invented technology and magic that would make use of the latent magical essence in the world. This was used in <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Skyship</a> technology, a combination of using <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Arcane Magic</a> and the natural <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Aether</a> of the world to transport yourself through the world.</p><p>The world got its name <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Ae&rsquo;thar</a> from the elvish for &ldquo;Air&rdquo;. The use and study of <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Arcane Magic</a> was the primary reason for this golden age of the world, it opened up many possibilities for everyone to harness magic, but it also exemplified the selfishness of those as well. One became so powerful she challenged the god of death itself, and won, taking his place, while others became so disillusioned with the gods that they thought themselves to be the true owners of the world.</p><p>This culminated in a chaotic war, like a <em>second Sundering</em>. A war of <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Dragon</a> versus man, gods versus gods, and man versus gods. Much of this age, the Age of Magic, has been lost to time, but its presence is ever so evident in the world we see today. Ruins and artifacts from this <em>second Sundering</em> tell of unknown battles and stories during this Age. It&rsquo;s speculated that only a fifth of the world population survived this event.</p><p>This war was a turning point in how the Prime Deities looked upon the world. They created the <a class=notfound href=/wiki/404>Divine Veil</a>, barring the gods from materializing on the world, and they could only influence the world through their most devout followers.</p><h1 id=age-of-man>Age of Man
