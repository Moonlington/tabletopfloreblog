Following my previous blogpost on my personal experiences with tabletop roleplaying games, [Agency, Ego, and Enjoyment: Rethinking My TTRPGs and Myself]({{< ref "Agency, Ego, and Enjoyment Rethinking My Role in RPGs">}}), I had an interesting chat with a friend of mine about what specifically I find is *fun* in this hobby. I kind of explained this in my previous blogpost, but it deserves its own post. Collaborative storytelling has quickly become the most important concept to understand in this hobby.
## Boredom, Disinterest, and Conflict
<!-- Talk about the general effect of not being engaged with the story going on, and how a reactive story ruins games -->
As a Game Master, one of the fears I had was worrying that my players weren't enjoying the content I prepared for them. This quickly lead to frustration towards myself for not preparing an interesting session, frustration towards my players for not engaging in the story the way I expected them to, and getting frustrated towards the entire campaign I was running, culminating in cancelling entire campaigns because they weren't fun for me or my players. 

There's two sides of the story at play here, a Game Master who spends a lot of time preparing adventures and a world for the players to play in, and players who bring the characters they spend a lot of time on to the sessions.
