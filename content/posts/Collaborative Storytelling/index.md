Following my previous blogpost on my personal experiences with tabletop roleplaying games, [Agency, Ego, and Enjoyment: Rethinking My TTRPGs and Myself]({{< ref "Agency, Ego, and Enjoyment Rethinking My Role in RPGs">}}), I had an interesting chat with a friend of mine about what specifically I find is *fun* in this hobby. I kind of explained this in my previous blogpost, but it deserves it's. I want to talk about what I have realized is the most important part of this hobby, collaborative storytelling, and its role.

## Boredom, Disinterest, and Conflict
<!-- Talk about the general effect of not being engaged with the story going on, and how a reactive story ruins games -->
One of the fears I personally experienced throughout my time participating in this hobby was the fear that my players weren't enjoying the content I spent time preparing for them. For me, this lead to being frustrated at the game I prepared, being frustrated at my players for not engaging in the story the way I expected them to, and eventually being so demotivated I would cancel the entire campaign. Looking at a TTRPG from above you see two sides of the story. There's the DM, who spends a lot of time preparing adventures and a world for the players to play in, and the players themselves, who bring the character they spent a lot of time on to the table.
