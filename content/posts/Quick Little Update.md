Hey all! Quick little post here to let everyone that still reads this blog know that I'm working on a couple different articles right now. Most of them are about how I personally run games or prepare sessions, while others are more about some parts of worldbuilding I love fleshing out in my worlds. I've been spending a lot of time lately working on Ae'thar, and it's been a blast, but I will return to writing articles on this blog soon. Stay tuned for those articles!
