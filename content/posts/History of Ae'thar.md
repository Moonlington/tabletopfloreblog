In this article I wish to both tell a bit of the history behind the world of *Ae'thar* and explain my thoughts and feelings on worldbuilding history in general. I promise you, my opinions are not that controversial.

## Wait, what's Ae'thar?

First thing's first, you might have wondered:

"Hey, wasn't this world called *Elysium* before? What is *Ae'thar* and why did the other articles change this name as well?"

Good question!

Personally, I was not happy with the name I chose for the world after I spent more time building it and figuring out what I wanted from it. I, now, as a writer and dungeon master, have a better vision of this world, and I'm enjoying it, a lot.

## Foundations of a World

You might look up how to start writing a history for your homebrew setting or world, and read that you should start with thinking of the origins of your world. Like, the creation myth, or your pantheon/gods. I guess it makes *chronological* sense, but I feel like some people would get stuck at this point while thinking of things they really want to write instead. I'm probably going to say this a lot in this article, but I think when it comes to writing in general, **focus** is extremely important. I'll come back to that word later.
