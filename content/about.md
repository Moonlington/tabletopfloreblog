Hello! I've suddenly had the inspiration to start this blog. I want to use it to write down my thoughts and ideas about worldbuilding and different TTRPGs.

## Who am I?

My name is Flore, a 21 year old guy living in the Netherlands, who has been playing D&D for almost four years now. Most of that time has been as a DM. I'm a big fan of Critical Role, which has been my main inspiration for being a DM, and creating my own worlds. I used to study Aerospace Engineering, but I have switched over to Computer Science this year. I am a DM for two groups of 6 and 7 people, where I make an attempt to prepare both sessions every week.

## Why make this blog?

Lately I've been spending a lot of time creating a lot of different worlds, like my dark and gloomy world of **Eden**, and the much more fantastical world of **Halcyon**. They are distinct in tone and execution, and I want to share the experiences I have had with creating and playing in those worlds.

While I could talk to my friends about any decisions and thoughts I have about these things. I can't really, y'know, write entire blog posts to my friends. They're not _that_ engaged in my musings.

Now some parts of this blog will be blocked out in white, only to be revealed when moused over. These blocks are parts of articles that I _do_ want to talk about but _can't_ for specific individuals, like my players.

Test spoiler below.

{{% spoiler %}}So this is how a spoiler would look like in the blog. Don't read it if its not for you.{{% /spoiler %}}

I hope some people can get enjoyment out of my ideas and thoughts, how bad or insignificant they might be. :)
