The precise origin of [[Halcyon]] is clouded in mystery. It is uncertain how the world came to be and some parts of history were not recorded or lost to time. The following is the widely regarded creation myth and history of the world.

## The Chaos of the Cosmos

In the beginning, there was only chaos, a messy cosmological and primordial soup that collided and conflicted with each other. It is believed to have been a universe of anger, rage, hate, and malevolence. Not of emotion, but of pure conflict. The forces that were at play are unknown and impossible to study. This continued until, from either beyond the [[cosmos]] or from within it, certain entities used their power and influence of the chaos to stabilize a part of it. These entities became known as the [[Deities]] of [[Halcyon]]. They collectively carved out a section of the cosmos to begin shaping their vision, and this section would eventually be known as the [[Prime Material Plane]]. While we know now that these entities became our deities, at the dawn of time they were still not fully formed, yet they were young and had ambitions.

Their attempt at creating order in the chaos was not overlooked, as quickly the rest of the cosmos fought to preserve their chaos and conflict. These entities fought back, however, and as one they created time and space for themselves, at least for now.

## The Creation of Man

As the world began to take its shape, the deities created lesser forms to inhabit their created realm. It was [[Titania]] who shaped the [[Elves]] first, who would walk upon the new world and gaze up at the heavenly skies as their creators continued to keep the cosmos at bay. Then, [[Mallus]] took it upon himself to forge the [[Dwarves]], with whom he instilled the same desire to tame the world, to _create_ something. Next was a third race, the [[Humans]], who were instilled with a sense of order by [[Aster]] and curiosity by [[Luna]] to bring meaning to the world. Despite their short lives, they were imbued with ambition, joy, and a sense of purpose.

After these three, the imagination of the deities became limitless. However, while more creations were birthed onto the world, not even the archives of the ancient city of [[Aurora]] could bring light to the origin and identities of other creations.

### The Gift of Magic

While the deities were protecting their unknowing creations from the hostile force outside of their realm, the creations themselves struggled to survive the harsh and unpredictable environments of an untamed world. They gained knowledge and attempted to build on the land, but even then many lives would be put out by their seemingly uncaring world. In an attempt to aid their creations, the deities gave them a tiny fragment of their power, a sliver of the creation magic that brought mankind to the realm in the first place, to protect and shape the world around them as they deemed appropriate. This was the earliest form of [[Divine Magic]].

As the deities bought more time for themselves and their creations, they took it upon themselves to take their creation's form and walk among them.

As time went on, more of what we now deem as normal came into existence. [[Aster]] and [[Luna]] gave a sense of rhythm to the world by having the star <!-- Give the star a name and link it --> shine its light upon the lands for half of the day, while the two moons, [[Majora]] and [[Minora]], kept a watchful eye during nightfall.

### The City of Aurora

The first spark of civilization was in [[Aurora]], the oldest surviving city in [[Halcyon]], where community and preservation grew important as the world around them was still harsh to its people. The city housed a tightly knit community that lived in peace and harmony despite the harsh outside. The city houses the earliest known temples to the deities, and the oldest known records of history, which are widely regarded as the primary source of understanding of the creation of our world. While there are various regional differences in the historical record, the broad strokes of this mythic history are undeniable.

It was in this city that mankind began to worship the deities, and it was only then that they were given name and form. The deities that we know now might have been significantly changed through this worship, but it is assumed that even before our world existed, the deities' thoughts and emotions were still unique to them, but only reinforced through worship.

## The Sundering

{{< seealso "The Sundering">}}
As mankind and the deities together poured their heart and soul into their realm, the chaos of the cosmos surrounding it only grew in anger and rage. It was only when the heavens began to fall and the world began to fight back in full force that mankind became aware of the wrath that outside forces were capable of. This event in history is called _the Sundering_.

Primal beings spewed forth from the earth and the seas and entities from beyond the heavens came down in an attempt at retaking what was theirs. There was still chaos and strife within the world that the deities created that laid dormant before that now reared its ugly head. This fight between the deities and the chaos fundamentally reshaped the land of [[Halcyon]], shattering its essence - it's [[Aether]] - across the spectrum. What was once an enormous stretch of land only surrounded by water, became an uncountable amount of floating islands and continents, all flying high above the unknowable depths of the [[Great Blue]].

### The Gift of the Arcane

As the deities and mankind became desperate to save their realm, the deities resorted to extreme measures. [[Luna]] gifted mankind with the ability to create magic on their own, without having to borrow the creation magic from the deities. This gave mankind more freedom and power over the world. The people that had a potency for this new kind of magic called themselves arcanists.

This newly given power gave the determined mortals the power to subdue some of the chaos in the realm and gave way for the deities to focus their efforts on the forces outside of the mortals' reach.

### Aftermath of the Sundering

Eventually, the chaos subsided, but not without loss. Only a tenth of the population survived, and it created a schism in the [[Deities]] about their world. Some wanted to protect it with all of their power, some wanted to return it to the cosmological chaos, as it was deemed a failure to them and too much to bear. This divide in the gods caused chaos and strife within and eventually culminated in the imprisonment of those that sought to bring the world to chaos. They were imprisoned in planes adjacent to the [[Prime Material Plane]], where they would be unable to influence the world. Those that sought to protect their creation became the [[Prime Deities]] of [[Halcyon]], while the others became known as the [[Traitor Gods]].

As the realm was now scattered and broken, most of the civilized world had to be rebuilt. [[Aurora]], stood the strongest, and even now is the only known continent that is still rooted in the [[Great Blue]]. The [[Elves]] that primarily inhabited it brought it back to its original glory, until the [[Dwarves]], [[Gnomes]], and [[Humans]] that lived in [[Aurora]] invented technology and magic that would make use of the latent magical essence in the world. This was used in [[Skyship]] technology, a combination of using [[Arcane Magic]] and the natural [[Aether]] of the world to transport yourself through the world.

### Golden age of Halcyon

Together with this new technology and the gift of the arcane, mankind sought to tame and master the new world in front of them, culminating in a golden age of the world. It opened up many possibilities for everyone to harness the world, magic, and its secrets. It is widely known as a long period of technological and magical progress for mankind, where magic users were able to innovate in unprecedented ways, completing difficult tasks with extreme ease. They spawned wondrous, but also dangerous, new forms of life and power.

## The Cataclysm

But this progress also culminated in a deep rot that spread through the world. It exemplified the arrogance and selfishness of mankind. One arcanist became so powerful that they challenged the god of death and fate, and won, taking his place among the gods, and subsequently making sure no one could gain that amount of power ever again. Others became so disillusioned with the gods that they thought themselves to be the true owners of the world. Some went even further, losing sight of the meaning and purpose the world of [[Halcyon]] had to them, and vowing to release the imprisoned gods to bring the world back to its primordial, cosmological, chaotic state.

One such powerful arcanist, together with a group of other arcanists, indulged himself in this nihilistic worldview and sought power from the imprisoned gods, succeeding in opening the gates of their prisons. The [[Traitor Gods]] warped their prisons into reflections of their corruption, and their prisons also warped them in diabolical and terrible ways. Their emotions of loss and grief from _[[the Sundering]]_ were twisted into hatred and an urge to dominate and ruin.

These newly released gods consolidated their power in secret, and after a while, declared war upon the world and the [[Prime Deities]]. The result was a magical arms race where man and god alike focussed their magical efforts on furthering the war effort.

This chaotic war over the future of the realm was seen almost as a _second Sundering_ and became known as _[[the Cataclysm]]_. While the battles that ensued during the Cataclysm have been lost to time, its presence is ever so evident in the world we see today. Ruins and artifacts from the war tell of unknown battles and stories. It's speculated that only a fifth of the world population survived this event, and for the most part, all traces of the old world were erased from the face of [[Halcyon]], leaving only a few ancient civilizations in well-preserved ruins.

## The Veiling

{{< seealso "The Veiling">}}
The victorious [[Prime Deities]] banished their betraying kin to their respective prison realms, and the world had to recover. The threat still existed, as anyone could be convinced by themselves alone to bring about a second _Cataclysm_. Another extreme measure was taken by the gods. They created the [[Divine Veil]], barring any god from materializing in the world, and they could only influence the world through their most devout followers. This left mankind to itself, to rebuild civilization, ushering in a new age of mankind.

### Age of Mankind

After the veiling of the world, each different portion of the world began its history. Some turned towards the [[Prime Deities]], some turned to the [[Arcane Magic|arcane]], but every single nation starts its new history, either starting anew or building on top of the ruins of old.
