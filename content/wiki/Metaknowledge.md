This wiki is meant for you to get a deeper understanding of the world of [[Ae'thar]], however it is important to mention that you should separate the knowledge you as a player gain from this wiki, and the knowledge your character has. As much as I highly appreciate someone digging deeper into this world of my making, please make sure to keep player knowledge and character knowledge seperate. When in doubt, you can always ask me about it, I'm happy to help!

The wiki will **never** contain spoilers for any campaign or character backstory. It will only contain information to immerse yourself in the history of the setting and its people.

_Thank you for reading this page, I appreciate it._
