The **Deities** of [[Halcyon]] are divided into the [[Prime Deities]], [[Traitor Gods]], and other lesser powers.

These lesser powers include [[archfey]], fiends and celestials of near-divine power (including [[archdevils]] and [[demon lords]]), [[elder dragons]], and other extremely powerful beings who reside on [[Halcyon]] itself, whether they are creations of the gods, other entities that can grant powers, or even mortals who have gained nearly divine powers.
