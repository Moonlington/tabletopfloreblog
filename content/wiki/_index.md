# Welcome to Flore's Worldbuilding Wiki!

Welcome to the wiki for my newer content. My older stuff used to be up on [XhoriaWiki](https://xhoria.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page), but ever since I was able to get my own site working, I felt like moving the newer content over to this site, instead of using the wiki that was originally supposed for just Xhoria.

## Preface

"Xhoria, the first fantasy world I started actually working on instead of dropping it in the bin. This world has been the product of many weeks of brainstorming and talking with my friends. I hope that this document will grow indefinitely over years and years of time. This short document will become a starter's guide to my world and will be updated regularly. This world will be the building block upon you and your friends will embark on a campaign I, as the DM, will come up with. I hope this world will bring many memories of you and you friends that you will cherish for a long while." - Flore, Nov 2019.

"I remember writing the previous statement long ago. This was still a small project of mine then. It's grown bigger than I ever would have thought, and it will not stop growing. Now that I've switched over to a wiki format I feel that the speed and quality of my work will increase tremendously. I hope you guys enjoy my work, and the previous statements still apply here." - Flore, Aug 2020.

"Right, It's been a while, I changed a lot of stuff, dumped a lot of old stuff, created a lot of new stuff. Such is the life of a worldbuilder. Ae'thar has been a great project which I feel confident in. No more unnecessary fluff, no more info bloat. Just fantasy fun." - Flore, Jan 2022.
