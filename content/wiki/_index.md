## Welcome to Flore's Worldbuilding Wiki

Welcome to the wiki for my newer content. My older stuff used to be up on [XhoriaWiki](https://xhoria.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page), but ever since I was able to get my own site working, I felt like moving the newer content over to this site, instead of using the wiki that was originally supposed for just Xhoria.

### Preface

_"Ever since I have played Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition with friends, I have been fascinated by the art of worldbuilding. I've designed and written about multiple worlds, most of them I personally now deem as insufficient or just kind of mediocre, mostly in comparison to what I am able to envision now._

_Xhoria was one of the first worlds I wrote, which quickly got out of hand as I started to write wider and wider, as to creating some depth, leading to a huge backlog that drained my motivation.
I wrote Eden, a short and small world focussed on a central idea, which was fun to explore.
Now I am writing Halcyon, a world where I am primarily focussing on what I find fun in a fantasy world. Exploration, mystery, conflict, drama, etc._

_As I have been able to spend more and more time thinking of my world and fleshing it out, sometimes completely changing fundamental things, I've grown to have a newfound appreciation for the craft of worldbuilding. It is a form of a creative outlet for myself, and I always find myself thinking of things to add, develop, write, etc. Sometimes these things will never get to see the light of day in a Dungeons and Dragons game, but I still like writing them._

_This wiki serves as a source of information for both myself and others interested in my world of Halcyon. I hope to give a sense of wonder and adventure by just reading these articles. I've gone through many stages when writing and designing my worlds._
_I've gone from primarily focussing on the game to more or less giving more attention to the world, and having the game be a product of the world, not the other way around."_
