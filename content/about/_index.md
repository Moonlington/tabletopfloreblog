# Who am I?
I'm Flore, 25 years old and I am from the Netherlands. I have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and work as a Cybersecurity Consultant. I've been playing Tabletop RPGs since 2018, most of that time as a DM. Back then I used to watch a lot of Critical Role, which was my initial inspiration for becoming a Game Master. I created the world of Halcyon, which is a fantasy world I am (semi) working on. 

## The games I play
I love playing tabletop roleplaying games and I love talking about them as well. Most of my years I have played Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, but recently I have been playing other systems such as Pathfinder 2nd Edition, MOTHERSHIP, and Delta Green.

My current main TTRPG is Delta Green, which has throughout 2025 quickly become my favorite game on the table. (Dedicated article on DG coming soon!)

Sharing my ideas and thoughts on the tabletop roleplaying hobby is what I want to do on this blog. I hope you get something interesting out of this blog, and even if not, that's fine too!
