Hello! I've suddenly had the inspiration to start this blog. I want to use it to write down my thoughts and ideas about worldbuilding and different TTRPGs.

## Who am I?

I go by the name Flore online, I'm 23 years old and I'm Dutch. I've been playing Tabletop RPGs for over five years now, most of that time as a DM. I used to watch a lot of Critical Role, which was my initial inspiration for becoming a Game Master and creating my own worlds.
