# Who am I?
I'm Flore, 24 years old and I am from the Netherlands. I have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and work as a Cybersecurity Consultant. I've been playing Tabletop RPGs since 2018, most of that time as a DM. Back then I used to watch a lot of Critical Role, which was my initial inspiration for becoming a Game Master. I created the world of Halcyon, which is a fantasy world I am (semi) working on. 

## The games I play
I love playing tabletop roleplaying games and I love talking about them as well. Most of my years I have played Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, but recently I have been playing other systems such as Pathfinder 2nd Edition, MOTHERSHIP, and Delta Green.

Sharing my ideas and thoughts on the tabletop roleplaying hobby is what I want to do on this blog. I hope you get something interesting out of this blog, and even if not, that's fine too!
