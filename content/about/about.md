Hello! I've suddenly had the inspiration to start this blog. I want to use it to write down my thoughts and ideas about worldbuilding and different TTRPGs.

## Who am I?

I go by the name Flore online, I am 23 years old and I am from the Netherlands. I have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and work as a Cybersecurity Consultant. I've been playing Tabletop RPGs for a long while now, most of that time as a DM. I used to watch a lot of Critical Role, which was my initial inspiration for becoming a Game Master and creating my own worlds. I created the world of Halcyon, which is a fantasy world I currently still am working on. I love playing tabletop roleplaying games and I love talking about them as well. Sharing my ideas and thoughts on the tabletop roleplaying hobby is what I want to do on this blog.
