I&amp;rsquo;ve suddenly had the inspiration to start this blog. I want to use it to write down my thoughts and ideas about worldbuilding and different TTRPGs.
Who am I? My name is Flore, a 22 year old man living in the Netherlands, who has been playing D&amp;amp;D for almost five years now. Most of that time has been as a DM. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Critical Role, which has been my main inspiration for being a DM and creating my own worlds.</description></item></channel></rss>
