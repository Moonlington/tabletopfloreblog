&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Flore, 24 years old and I am from the Netherlands. I have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and work as a Cybersecurity Consultant. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing Tabletop RPGs since 2018, most of that time as a DM. Back then I used to watch a lot of Critical Role, which was my initial inspiration for becoming a Game Master. I created the world of Halcyon, which is a fantasy world I am (semi) working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-games-i-play"&gt;The games I play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love playing tabletop roleplaying games and I love talking about them as well. Most of my years I have played Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 5th Edition, but recently I have been playing other systems such as Pathfinder 2nd Edition, MOTHERSHIP, and Delta Green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current main TTRPG is Delta Green, which has throughout 2025 quickly become my favorite game on the table. (Dedicated article on DG coming soon!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing my ideas and thoughts on the tabletop roleplaying hobby is what I want to do on this blog. I hope you get something interesting out of this blog, and even if not, that&amp;rsquo;s fine too!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
