It quickly became my de facto roleplaying game. After finishing my &lt;strong&gt;Impossible Landscapes&lt;/strong&gt; campaign, preparing to start a new one called &lt;strong&gt;Echo Chamber&lt;/strong&gt;, and writing my own short operation, &lt;strong&gt;Slaughterhouse&lt;/strong&gt;, I felt compelled to spread the word about this fantastic system. So here I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-i-got-into-delta-green"&gt;How I got into Delta Green&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off with Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 5th Edition and moved on to fantasy games like Pathfinder 2nd Edition, while also experimenting with titles such as Mothership and Blades in the Dark for a different vibe. Thinking back, I’ve always loved horror elements in roleplaying games, and I kept implementing them into the games I ran. I’ve never run Call of Cthulhu, though I did play in a short campaign&amp;hellip; and I wasn’t much of a fan. It felt too pulpy for me, and the subject matter never felt particularly horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my friend showed me Delta Green for the first time, a game that originally was a supplement for Call of Cthulhu, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think too much of it. We skimmed the free starter rulebook, &lt;strong&gt;Need to Know&lt;/strong&gt;, and thought it was pretty cool. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I watched &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/mx_yZHzfoHg" target="_blank"&gt;Quinns Quest&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s review of Delta Green and Impossible Landscapes that I really started to get into the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set out to gather a group of friends, run the introductory one-shot Last Things Last, play an operation in the middle, and then dive into the depths of Impossible Landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve finished the campaign as a Handler (Delta Green’s Game Master), I can’t overstate how much I’ve come to love this system, its themes, gameplay, ideas, and world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-theme-of-delta-green"&gt;The Theme of Delta Green&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People come to Delta Green for many different reasons. They may like to weave a story, fashion a mystery, or devise some new horror. Whatever the reasons, in the end, that creation is never simple. When all the layers of the investigation are pulled back, more often than not, what is revealed is the stark nothingness of infinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delta Green is about the end of humanity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may make it seem to be about other things from time to time. About family. About life. About the things that make us human. It has all these things, but that’s not what it’s about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It lies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delta Green is not about love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delta Green is not about safety.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delta Green is not about reason.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delta Green is about humanity’s true place in the universe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that place is nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote, taken from Delta Green&amp;rsquo;s official &lt;a href="https://www.delta-green.com/about/" target="_blank"&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt; expertly sets the tone for the game. It&amp;rsquo;s dark, it&amp;rsquo;s depressing, it&amp;rsquo;s bleak, but the characters keep on fighting for their own personal motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Call of Cthulhu&amp;rsquo;s setting of the Roaring 20s where you play as old-timey investigators, Delta Green takes modern-day government workers brought into the covert group whose mission is to investigate, contain, and conceal unnatural incursions and asks very tough choices from them. How do you deal with the unnatural, while also keeping it a secret from everyone? How do you convince local law enforcement that nothing out of the ordinary is going on? On who do you pin the deaths the monster has caused? It&amp;rsquo;s less &amp;rsquo;this is a scary thing&amp;rsquo; horror and more &amp;lsquo;how can I live with myself?&amp;rsquo; horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re playing as a regular guy, an FBI Agent, a CDC analyst, a local cop, having to deal with horrors beyond understanding, barely surviving them, and having their relationship with their family get ruined by the consequences of their actions as a reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I love about Delta Green is that not only is the tone, setting, and theme something I personally really like, the actual mechanics and gameplay support this same tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="playing-delta-green"&gt;Playing Delta Green&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta Green uses the familiar d100 system from Call of Cthulhu. Agents have six core attributes, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Power, and Charisma, and around forty skills. Character creation is very flexible, you can make any investigator, scientist, pathologist, historian, computer scientist, anything really that you want to play as. Agents also track Hit Points (HP), often perilously low; Willpower Points (WP), which drain as quickly as you’re willing to spend them; and Sanity Points (SAN), which will eventually be an Agent’s undoing, assuming they aren’t physically destroyed first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way skills work in Delta Green is simple and straightforward, you roll under the percentage in that skill, and you succeed. Interestingly, when circumstances are calm and controlled, you often don’t roll dice at all. The Handler decides based on how high your skill rating is if you succeed or not, or how long something takes. This removes some of the infuriating randomness that can derail mystery-style scenarios and reinforces that Agents are competent experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the Agent&amp;rsquo;s Handbook gives enough simulation through tables and rules to play the game and make meaningful and interesting choices, while staying simple enough such that the Handler doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to constantly refer back to the book to know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Delta Green really shines is when it comes to Bonds. Every Agent has 2-4 Bonds. They measure the relationship between your Agent and the vital people in their life. This can be loved ones, family members, close friends, etc. Bonds are a crucial part of your Agent&amp;rsquo;s story during play. The unique thing that Delta Green does that I personally really love is that when you lose SAN, you can choose to divert some of that onto a bond, reducing the amount of SAN you lose in the moment. The next time your Agent interacts with that Bond, you decide how this loss in that Bond manifests. Does the Agent get angry? Do they become too reliant on the bond? Do they abandon them for other people?
For example, your Agent returns home and lashes out at their spouse for asking where they’ve been. It adds drama purely through mechanics, a roleplay edge woven directly into the rules, something I rarely see in other TTRPGs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-delta-green-books"&gt;The Delta Green Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently own the &lt;strong&gt;Agent’s Handbook&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Handler’s Guide&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Impossible Landscapes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;God’s Teeth&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;God’s Hunt&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;The Conspiracy&lt;/strong&gt; in physical form, with &lt;strong&gt;A Night at the Opera&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Black Sites&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Dead Drops&lt;/strong&gt; hopefully arriving soon. I own all the books in PDF form, but I really wanted to have the physical books as well. The &lt;strong&gt;Agent&amp;rsquo;s Handbook&lt;/strong&gt; does a great job of setting the tone and explaining the rules, &lt;strong&gt;Impossible Landscapes&lt;/strong&gt; is a fantastic module which I will review at a later date, and the other books are all filled with either great background information and lore of Delta Green, or well-written operations to either string together into a campaign, or run separately. I keep coming back to &lt;strong&gt;The Conspiracy&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Handler&amp;rsquo;s Guide&lt;/strong&gt; to harvest ideas or get a better sense of the unnatural world of Delta Green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slight tangent on the Quinns Quest review that I want to get off my chest: I don&amp;rsquo;t have an issue with saying that you can skip the &lt;strong&gt;Handler&amp;rsquo;s Guide&lt;/strong&gt;, since it isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary to run the game. I do have an issue with the weird disdain the review had for the book. I wish the review was a little more nuanced with not recommending the &lt;strong&gt;Handler&amp;rsquo;s Guide&lt;/strong&gt; instead of just kinda&amp;hellip; shitting on it? I feel the main takeaway from Quinn&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on the &lt;strong&gt;Handler&amp;rsquo;s Guide&lt;/strong&gt; is less &amp;ldquo;you don&amp;rsquo;t need to have the book to run your games,&amp;rdquo; which is a valid take, and more &amp;ldquo;the book is nerd shit (derogatory), its not worth getting it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, tangent over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-do-my-players-think-of-delta-green"&gt;What do my players think of Delta Green?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked my players if they wanted to add something to the article themselves about their experiences with Delta Green and our Impossible Landscapes campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One player sent me a long reflection, and I want to include it in full because it meant a lot to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, unprompted by Flore and mostly reminiscing about the campaign and enjoying the attention of me making our friend Matin cry after her helplessness to save my character, I was thinking that Delta Green, in my opinion, probably got us to bond more together—which is very ironic about it considering the self-destruction of your character’s bonds with others!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned it on a bsky post to Detwiller (co-creator of Delta Green and author of Impossible Landscapes (IL)) that I was eyeing up Delta Green for years but never made a jump. Flore had dived in on my behalf, and I followed into a strange labyrinth of surreal horror that IL sets up (coincidentally my favourite type of horror!). I absolutely adored the experience, it was a blast, and I am so proud of Flore being able to run it smoothly from start to finish after being a witness to his Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons campaigns and the lack of motivated people at the table who aren’t him or myself. It was really inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flore has asked me to say what I like and do not like about Delta Green, and I can wholeheartedly say I like everything—especially the post-modern setting inspired by conspiracy theories (1990s Delta Green is like Deus Ex (2000))! I see only pros and no personal cons with Delta Green as a system. This might change with more time in the system, and seeing a con in future is not even a true negative as it might inspire me to create something as I believe I should never judge if I cannot create a solution to resolve my personal problem. I want to play more Delta Green! The cosmic horror side of this is exciting, and I will be open-minded even if surreal horror is my favourite subgenre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished running BLACKSAT from Control Group in my own group and despite reading the adventure twice before running I felt like I was stumbling following a pre-written adventure which is not my usual forte. HUGE respect for Flore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close, the too long; did not read is I love my friends and Flore put his heart and soul into this, and I hope he can see how much we appreciated his effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one of my players said this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big fan of the bonds/sanity system because it allows for organic storytelling and makes a gameplay aspect a story aspect as well (if you have no-one any more you go nuts more easily, makes sense). I think one thing I disliked isn&amp;rsquo;t really a problem with the system but more with my mindset going in, the dnd-type mindset where you&amp;rsquo;re trying to look at inventory and stats and trying to use all that because it&amp;rsquo;s there - you generally don&amp;rsquo;t need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THAT SAID I do think there&amp;rsquo;s WAY too many skills and they could be a bit more generalized, like even if points are kind of fake it does feel bad to make your character great at heavy machinery which then just straight up doesn&amp;rsquo;t come up. It feels like an artifact of an older, more classic ttrpg. The most fun ones are the bonus art/language ones, there should be more of that (like weird specializations that only come up once but are relevant in the moment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next-for-me"&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next for me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the introduction, I’m currently outlining a new campaign for my friends called &lt;strong&gt;Echo Chamber&lt;/strong&gt;, which draws operations from &lt;strong&gt;A Night at the Opera&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Black Sites&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dead Drops&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;The Labyrinth&lt;/strong&gt;, weaving them into a single overarching narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also writing a short scenario I hope to submit to the 2025 Delta Green Shotgun Scenario Contest called &lt;strong&gt;Slaughterhouse&lt;/strong&gt; based on some of the horror stuff that I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides those two things, I want to write a comprehensive review on &lt;strong&gt;Impossible Landscapes&lt;/strong&gt; as a module next. I really liked that module and I want to share my thoughts on it as well. I also want to write some short articles with tips and tricks on running &lt;strong&gt;Impossible Landscapes&lt;/strong&gt;, just to help out any new Handlers that want to know what they&amp;rsquo;re getting into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, I’ll be playing a lot more Delta Green.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>True Essence of Tabletop Roleplaying Games: Collaborative Storytelling</title><link>https://www.tabletopflore.com/posts/collaborative-storytelling/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.tabletopflore.com/posts/collaborative-storytelling/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Following my previous blogpost on my personal experiences with tabletop roleplaying games, &lt;a href="https://www.tabletopflore.com/posts/agency-ego-enjoyment/"&gt;Agency, Ego, and Enjoyment: Rethinking My TTRPGs and Myself&lt;/a&gt;, I had an interesting chat with a friend of mine about what specifically I find is &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; in this hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That conversation helped me realize that the true essence of tabletop roleplaying isn’t found in the rules, mechanics, or even the stories we write. What truly defines the hobby is the shared act of &lt;em&gt;collaborative storytelling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="boredom-disinterest-and-conflict"&gt;Boredom, Disinterest, and Conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a game loses engagement, it doesn’t have to happen suddenly. Sometimes it’s a slow process: a few distracted moments here and there, lukewarm responses to plot hooks, a growing sense of disconnection. Everyone quietly becomes aware that something feels off, but no one mentions it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Game Master, one of the fears I’ve always had is that my players aren’t enjoying what I’ve prepared. That fear often led to frustration: frustration at myself for not writing a better session, frustration at my players for not engaging the way I expected, and finally frustration at the game itself for not “working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tension always has &lt;em&gt;two sides:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The GM,&lt;/strong&gt; who has poured time into creating a world and story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The players,&lt;/strong&gt; who have invested emotionally in their characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a player’s personal story doesn’t feel relevant, or when a GM’s setup doesn’t get the intended response, those investments stop aligning and &lt;strong&gt;collaborative storytelling&lt;/strong&gt; begins to break down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story becomes reactive instead of co-created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GM responds to players’ disinterest by tightening control. The players, sensing that control, engage less. It becomes a cycle that ends in boredom and burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-reactive-story-problem"&gt;The Reactive Story Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reactive story is one where only one side, usually the GM, moves the plot forward. Players &lt;em&gt;react&lt;/em&gt; to the prewritten content but don’t meaningfully change it. It feels less like a conversation and more like watching someone else’s story unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve realized that the more my games became reactive, the more disconnected I felt from the people I was playing with. In those moments we weren’t telling a story &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;; I was telling &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; story, and the others were just actors in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day I still struggle with this problem. I would love to have more sessions where I can set the scene and watch the players play as their characters in it. Even as a player I feel it too, where I would love to have the space and freedom to express myself in character without being bound by the tight schedule of a TTRPG session. It goes both ways in the social contract that we sign for playing roleplaying games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="effects-of-engagement"&gt;Effects of Engagement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When players and GMs are truly collaborating, you can feel the creative energy flowing through everyone at the table. It’s in the pauses between dialogue, the sudden shift when someone introduces a new twist that just &lt;em&gt;clicks&lt;/em&gt;, and everyone leans closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engagement creates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Ownership.&lt;/strong&gt; The world belongs to everyone at the table. Players feel free to contribute, and GMs feel supported rather than drained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emergent Storytelling.&lt;/strong&gt; The best moments often come from improvisation and shared emotion rather than preparation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Payoff.&lt;/strong&gt; When everyone helps build the story, the emotional beats hit harder. The triumphs and losses feel &lt;em&gt;earned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust.&lt;/strong&gt; Players trust that their ideas will be respected. GMs trust that players will take the story seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When players are engaged, my workload as a GM actually &lt;em&gt;decreases.&lt;/em&gt; I prep less because I know my players will fill in the gaps. I am not Atlas carrying the world on my back; we’re all holding it up together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While playing in a Pathfinder 2nd Edition game that my friend is running, he introduced us players to the concept of &lt;strong&gt;Proactive Fun&lt;/strong&gt;, taken from &lt;em&gt;The Game Master’s Handbook of Proactive Roleplaying&lt;/em&gt; by Jonah and Tristan Fishel. It focuses on encouraging players to take initiative in setting personal goals for their characters to pursue and complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These can be short-term goals (“I want to get out of jail”) or long-term goals (“I want to break the curse plaguing my family line”), but they are always meaningful and—most importantly—energizing for the player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a GM, this information is invaluable! It shows what players truly want for their characters and provides natural stepping stones for future prep. It shifts storytelling from being reactive to a more collaborative setting. Definitely a tool I want to use in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="leveraging-this-in-your-games"&gt;Leveraging This in Your Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you build this kind of engagement intentionally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1-introduce-proactive-goals"&gt;1. Introduce Proactive Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encourage each player to define a few goals for their character: short-term, mid-term, and long-term. These can evolve and be added to over time. Then, as the GM, build your sessions around opportunities for those goals to intersect with each other, with the world, or with the campaign’s larger themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This changes your prep from “designing a story” to “setting the stage” for players to tell their stories &lt;em&gt;through action&lt;/em&gt;. It also reduces your prep-work as you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what your players and their characters want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2-build-characters-into-the-world"&gt;2. Build Characters into the World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t just place player characters inside your plot. Let their goals, relationships, and fears shape the world around them. Their choices should matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be the characters biggest fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3-focus-on-play-not-performance"&gt;3. Focus on “Play,” Not “Performance”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need cinematic perfection. Collaborative storytelling thrives on curiosity and openness, not polish. A lot of TTRPGs thrive on both sides of the table not knowing what is going to happen. Let yourself be surprised by your players, or implement more randomness in your prep-work, like random tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also reduces the chance that you fall into the common pitfall trap of &amp;lsquo;writing a story&amp;rsquo; instead of &amp;lsquo;running a game.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="closing-thoughts"&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When players are engaged in your TTRPG game, they stop being passengers in your story and start being co-authors. Looking back on my earlier reflections about ego and agency, I realize that collaborative storytelling balances both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everyone at the table becomes engaged, the story no longer belongs to any one person. It belongs to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where the fun really lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Agency, Ego, and Enjoyment: Rethinking My TTRPGs and Myself</title><link>https://www.tabletopflore.com/posts/agency-ego-enjoyment/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.tabletopflore.com/posts/agency-ego-enjoyment/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all, it has been a while. A lot has happened in the years I did not write for my blog, like graduating and relationship things. I would like to write about the journey I went on playing roleplaying games and what I have personally learnt from them. See this as a journey throughout my experience with tabletop roleplaying games, but also as a vent piece. I just need to get things off my head. The post might feel aimless, and I am aware of this, this is more for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have been part of the games I am mentioning in this post, and I just want to say that I always enjoyed playing in your games and/or playing alongside you and that there are no bad feelings, this post is purely self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before I start, I would like to thank a close and dear friend of mine who inspired me to make this post. They made a similar reflection post after their campaign that got me thinking about my own firsthand experiences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You know who you are and thank you for all you have done for me recently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="session-0-expectations-or-a-lack-of"&gt;Session 0: Expectations, or a Lack of&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first experiences with roleplaying games must have been in 2012-2013, when I was invited by a friend of mine back then to play in this game called Dungeons and Dragons. Back then I was a lot shyer and more inexperienced with talking to a bunch of people. It did not help that I was extremely young too in a group with two other people that probably were a decade older than me. We played as a group of 4 (3 players + 1 DM). My character back then was an elf cleric of Selûne, who for some reason became the face of the group in the first session we had together, which was not the right choice. I can hardly remember any of the other characters, other than a Tiefling rogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that this experience with roleplaying games is what started my love for this hobby, this was a &lt;strong&gt;nightmare&lt;/strong&gt; for young me. I vividly remember our last session, where I was suddenly tasked by the DM with talking to this NPC. I could have mentioned to this NPC various things we saw on our way to the place, but for some reason I froze and did not know what to say. I was so embarrassed that I left the Skype call, pretending my internet went down, and never had a session with them again. The pressure was just too much for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I started becoming a DM and playing the game for real, I also took part in play-by-post game on Discord around 2015-2016. This is, what I feel, my first actual experience with the hobby. We played 5e, but very much in the background. We were basically roleplaying in a text chat, while the DM would roll things in private for when we made attacks or attempts for various things. We never saw any rolls, we just roleplayed. Whether this is really 5e or not, who is to say. There were two parts to this online game, one was where I played a goblin that joined in mid-campaign, and the other was where I played a sorcerer (I think?) that kind of went out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goblin part of that game was fun, I vividly remember killing a giant spider and taking a tooth to use as a new knife, but other than that I cannot really remember that much about that mini campaign either. The other part of that game was less so, early on I once again was forced to become the face of the party, and I was presented with the illusion of a choice. I say &amp;lsquo;illusion&amp;rsquo; because the DM was expecting me to take the &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; choice (to them). This did not sit well with me and the DM and the rest of the group, since I chose the more interesting choice for me. Eventually this group also fell apart after some arguments, and I did not play for a while after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinking back, those first few sessions have not affected me in the present time as much, even if it is my first few experiences with the hobby. As a nod to this small part of my experience, I made my first character in Baldur’s Gate 3 a cleric to Selûne as well. The other two games are interesting to me, since it is actually the first time I had a negative experience with this hobby that stemmed from not setting expectations from the start. Something that will come up later in life as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="figcaption"&gt;Zephyr, my first BG3 character, it was a ton of fun playing this game with you three. It might not be a tabletop roleplaying game but it is still a game dear to my heart.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="session-1-inspiration"&gt;Session 1: Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrive in December 2018, when I started my own campaign. I had been watching Critical Role for a little while and thought to myself: “Why not play this game with my high school friends?” What followed was a yearlong campaign which I will remember fondly as one of the most fun experiences I have ever had with friends. We called our group &amp;lsquo;Dungeons and Lads,&amp;rsquo; and I tried to tell what I thought was an interesting fantasy story taking place in my first homebrew world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p class="md__image"&gt;
&lt;img class="figureimg" id="zoom-default" src="img/first%20map.jpg" alt="My first ever world map"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="figcaption"&gt;My first ever world map, made in Wonderdraft. While this definitely is not my best work, it is fun in its own right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was the game I ran good? &lt;strong&gt;Hell no.&lt;/strong&gt; I just started being a DM playing with 7+ players, the story was kind of dumb and overambitious, and our combats were extremely unbalanced at times. I also kept adding more homebrew features because they sounded cool. This just went on and on for months until they got TPK&amp;rsquo;ed, and that campaign ended after we all decided that would be best for us all. The most important part of this though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had fun with my friends.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this extremely silly campaign, we ran another couple shorter campaigns, mostly ending due to multiple TPKs, until one of my players wanted to run a game for himself. After being a DM for two years I wanted to try out being a player again. I first played a water genasi druid that was searching for a dryad to thank them for backstory reasons. My idea was that this would become a nice emotional capstone somewhere down the road, little did I know that my entire backstory would be resolved within the first couple of sessions, leaving me with little to work with. There were other things that happened during this time, friction between the friend who was the DM in that campaign and me, us dealing with COVID era roleplaying, the abusive relationship I was in, and university stress kicking in hard. I made that character leave the party to then rejoin as a human fighter/samurai. After a while I stopped being in that campaign, since things got too much for me in general, and eventually distanced myself from that entire friend group for years. I have not spoken to most of them for four years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p class="md__image"&gt;
&lt;img class="figureimg" id="zoom-default" src="img/sac.png" alt="My second campaign map"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="figcaption"&gt;My second campaign map, smaller scale, but there was enough to do. I really dislike this map looking back. Theres so much empty space. This was part of a way bigger project where I was creating an entire planet. Someday I will share that here as well.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I look back at this period with joy and shame, as this was probably the most fun I have had with friends in this hobby, but it is also the worst period of my personal life for a while. The quality of my games also became worse and worse as time went on. I started to become increasingly focused on the game and less on having fun with friends. A crucial mistake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="session-2-ego"&gt;Session 2: Ego&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this period comes December of 2020, I reconnected with a few people from that high school friend group and started a new set of campaigns for two years. I created new worlds, new ideas, and played some other tabletop roleplaying games like Blades in the Dark, Ten Candles, &lt;del&gt;and Maid RPG for a one-shot&lt;/del&gt;. These games filled in the hole left by me not participating in other games anymore. On one side they were fun, but my priority was not having fun with my friends, they were creating and playing a good game. I was focused on creating a world that would be interesting to interact with, for them to play in, but not really for them to have fun in. The obvious conclusion of this came when I personally stopped enjoying the hobby when there was a disconnect in our group I did not know how to deal with properly at the time. One player wanted to take in the world a little bit and do some stuff unrelated to the main quest at the time, and another player told them that that was a waste of time. This triggered something in me that recontextualized a lot of what I was doing and how I was running this campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p class="md__image"&gt;
&lt;img class="figureimg" id="zoom-default" src="img/lunari.png" alt="Lunari Dominion"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="figcaption"&gt;Map of the Lunari Dominion, half of the setting for the last campaign with this group. I enjoyed this map a lot, but I wish I put more time and effort into making every bit of it unique. Something I would learn in my newer campaigns and ideas.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to really think about what my players were doing in my campaign and why. Was it because they wanted to, or was it because I wanted them to do it? Did they have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; agency in the campaign at all? Were they having even having fun? &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Were they enjoying the game at all or were they just looking forward to the day we all got together to hang out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; A lot happened in my mind and surrounding it, and I eventually concluded that the effort I put into the game was not being respected, as I thought some people did not seem to care about the game I was running at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking back, this is just completely wrong. It was an egotistical conclusion. I should have talked to my group about it instead of slowly but surely drifting apart again. I am glad I still have some contact with some of you, but I wish we could have continued playing this hobby together, hopefully the right way. If any of you read this, I am sorry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="session-3-running-and-playing-games"&gt;Session 3: Running and Playing Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the same period, I started a campaign with some of my online friends on Discord, which was an interesting campaign to say the least. I was dealing with a lot of personal stuff at the time, and juggling 2-3 campaigns at a time was not the brightest idea I had. The game was fun at parts, but it devolved into an “adventure of the week” style game that also did not prioritize the fun I was having with friends and instead was prioritizing the game again. It did not help when one of my players, in my attempt to run Wild Beyond the Witchlight for them, got really annoyed about levelling up and loot. That, plus the fact that people just stopped showing up for sessions just completely soured a lot of my enjoyment of the hobby as a whole. &lt;del&gt;Besides all that, I will never forget Sean, the flying monkey that died in our campaign.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p class="md__image"&gt;
&lt;img class="figureimg" id="zoom-default" src="img/suriel.png" alt="Darkshore and East Suriel"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="figcaption"&gt;Darkshore and East Suriel, two maps combined. This map rules, I love how it looks. This one was made before the Lunari one, but after the Steel Anvil Coast one, so it still suffers from putting things in places for the sake of putting them there with no thought behind it at all, but it looks cool as hell.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped playing tabletop roleplaying games for a while until I got invited to play in a game run by another online friend of mine. We played through Dragons of Stormwreck Isle, which is a really good adventure! The only thing that did not sit well with me personally was how, just like the other game I played in, my character and the story I wanted to tell with the group was taken from me and resolved before I could do anything, again leaving me with nothing. This is not the fault of the DM. The fault lies in the fact that we did not discuss these things in the open beforehand. Managing expectations is a huge part of this hobby, and I feel that when this does not happen, it leads to unwanted friction and conflict. It soured that game for me, and when I saw it happen to other people as well, it got worse. This is not a conscious thing the DM did, nor did they have any bad intention with this. It is purely a communcation error. It is something I keep thinking about when reflecting on the hobby. Overall, though, I really enjoyed the additions the DM made to the story and adventure. It is a shame their campaign fell apart after a long hiatus the way it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my IRL game fell apart, I continued working on my world, and I still am. Worldbuilding is a big part of being a DM for me. It is an amazing creative outlet where I can do whatever I want. I am still learning and still figuring out what I want from my world, but now that I have the time and motivation to continue, I will try to post more on this blog as well about my journey at this time. I like writing in general, be it these blogposts, stories, or worldbuilding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had run a short campaign with another group of online friends that sort of fell apart multiple times, not because of any issues in the game, but because of circumstances outside of it. Two years in a row a close family member was hospitalized and the time surrounding that was incredibly stressful for me. This combined with a very sparse gaming schedule because of time zone differences within our group made it exceedingly difficult for me to focus on running the game for my friends. On one hand it felt bad because I genuinely enjoy running games for friends, but on the other hand we were all slowly becoming increasingly disconnected with the story we were all telling because we did not play that much. It drained my motivation to continue, and even to this day I still technically have one session to run for this campaign, but because of personal reasons I just cannot. I am sorry to those that enjoyed that campaign, I hope someday I can make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p class="md__image"&gt;
&lt;img class="figureimg" id="zoom-default" src="img/lyridia&amp;amp;orpheios.png" alt="Lyridia &amp;amp; Orpheios"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="figcaption"&gt;Lyridia &amp;amp; Orpheios, one of a set of maps I made for my currently worked on world. For the record, these are floating continents in the sky, if that was not obvious. It is probably my best map out of all the ones I have made. I made this one back in 2022 and I still want to change some things about it. But I just love how this looks; it really evokes the fantasy world feeling that I want to emulate.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being frustrated with a lot of extra work me and my DM friends had to put in to make 5e work the way we wanted it to; we tried out Pathfinder 2nd Edition. A quite different take on the tabletop roleplaying game, a take I am still not entirely sure I find myself agreeing with. Its focus on combat and tactical gameplay in my experience seems to slightly take away from other aspects of the roleplaying game. This might just be an isolated incident but it is something I have personally noticed outside of this game as well. We played the short introductory adventure to get an idea of how the system worked and then jumped into a yearlong campaign for Abomination Vaults, which was a bunch of fun most of the time. I started off playing an elf swashbuckler, who died, and then played a half-orc barbarian. Sidenote: Barbarians in Pathfinder 2nd edition are extremely fun. It feels good when your normal hits do as much damage as someone else&amp;rsquo;s critical hit. Of course there is some friction with the structure of adventure, plus a relatively new DM, plus a new system, a lot of stuff that went &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; well, which lead to the overall experience maybe not being as we all expected and wanted. However, our DM did an excellent job running the adventure, it was a fun experience. Only thing I personally missed was a bit of roleplay inside of the game. Around halfway through there was a general shift in play dynamic where we were more focused on beating the adventure and maximizing our combat potential, and not telling a story together. This is partially a product of the structure of the adventure and the way it was interpreted (a megadungeon that heavily focuses on combat). Still fun, just in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p class="md__image"&gt;
&lt;img class="figureimg" id="zoom-default" src="img/arcraig.png" alt="Arcraig styling on a devil"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="figcaption"&gt;Arcraig, played by a friend of mine, shield styling on a devil inside the Abomination Vaults, my character Drogath, the half-orc barbarian, burning in the background after killing a big bone devil. This is the most beautiful piece of art that came out of this Pathfinder campaign.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have now run 3 sessions of MOTHERSHIP&amp;rsquo;s introductory adventure &amp;ldquo;Another Bug Hunt&amp;rdquo; and I must say that this campaign has been a lot of fun for me personally. I hope for my players as well. MOTHERSHIP is a very rules lite system that really focuses down on interaction between players and the world. There have been sessions where almost no dice had been rolled, we were just telling a story together. The sessions where we did roll a lot though did feel slightly different. It felt like we were playing a different game instead of playing the same game. This is a thing I have noticed throughout the years, and I do not exactly know how to put this into words yet, but there is some part of the game that feels like it is in opposition with the roleplaying side of a roleplaying game. I really want to explore this idea a bit further in a future post after I have done a bit more thinking. I still have one or two more sessions to run for this adventure as of me writing this post, and I am fully committed to finishing this campaign for sure. Hopefully after this campaign we can dive into &amp;lsquo;Gradient Descent&amp;rsquo; which is a fantastic looking &amp;lsquo;megadungeon&amp;rsquo; for MOTHERSHIP with an amazing atmosphere and core idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="figcaption"&gt;Screenshot of my MOTHERSHIP setup in Foundry. Being free from having to make maps and really focusing on making my descriptions as vivid as possible has been really refreshing for me. It opened my eyes to the possibilities that exist within the hobby.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This period for me is a bit of a weird one, since it is a time where I got to participate in other peoples&amp;rsquo; games and run campaigns with different people. It made me realize and internalize the fact that not everyone expects the same thing from tabletop roleplaying games. People play tabletop roleplaying games for distinct reasons, and that is fine. Playing MOTHERSHIP with that specific group also made me realize that once you do play with people that have similar expectations, the game can be elevated to a whole new level.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="session-4-recall-knowledge"&gt;Session 4: Recall Knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have summarized my entire tabletop roleplaying journey from start to finish, I want to spend some time reflecting on what happened and how I can improve my games and my life as well in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play.&lt;/strong&gt; There have been moments where I have thought to myself that I would not play tabletop roleplaying games anymore for a while. This mostly came due to bad experiences and life sometimes being very annoying and demotivating at times. Looking back throughout these 10+ years of play, I have realized that this hobby is important to me. Not just as a creative outlet, but for a way to have fun with friends. There have been times where this was not my main goal when participating in the hobby, and I genuinely regret those times. I have lost friends over this game, but also gained new ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set expectations.&lt;/strong&gt; Have session zeroes, talk with the players, incorporate their ideas with your ideas. A major part of getting too obsessed with your own work is, well, protecting it like it is your own. A big realization I have had is that this is, at its core, a collaborative storytelling game. There really should not be any reason for the players&amp;rsquo; input to be besides your own work. Structuring my campaigns in such a way that the story is focused on the player characters and not just on the player group will bring a lot more engagement and enjoyment out of this game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play different systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 5th edition is cool and all but Pathfinder 2nd edition is an interesting and opinionated take on the game as well. MOTHERSHIP and its rules lite nature also bring a new view on the hobby. Blades in the Dark gives players a lot more agency in play, making the tabletop dynamic interesting and honestly very cool. &lt;del&gt;Maid RPG is just funny for one session.&lt;/del&gt; Ten Candles also is a lot more collaborative with its storytelling, even more than Blades in the Dark. Playing different games also gives a broader view of not just the game but being a DM. Theres ideas that I can take from MOTHERSHIP that apply to any game I run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep groups small.&lt;/strong&gt; It is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much more comfortable running games that have only 3-4 players than 5+. With a smaller group it obviously makes scheduling easier, but it also makes it a more personal game. As a DM it makes it easier to spend more time on each player than having to thinly spread it over all players each session. If possible, I want to make every session as engaging as possible for as long as possible. This is not a very achievable goal at times, but let me tell you, having only three or four people to keep engaged is a lot easier than eight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take my time.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes I rush things. Rushing things leads to creating things that I am personally unhappy with, and having to work with those rushed things leads to general unhappiness when running games. I really must learn to take time to make my games as good as possible. Not that I should take weeks for a session, but things that should take a little bit of time, like maps or worldbuilding, should assume some more time. Let ideas grow over time than jotting down what is in my head right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take it easy.&lt;/strong&gt; I do not have to make battlemaps for every occasion, theres enough to find online. I do not need special rules for anything homebrew or special occasions. All the homebrew things I added to my first games are all gone at the moment, they bloated the game up and it slowly lost the collaborative storytelling aspect by being buried under rules. As for battlemaps, they just take too much time. I have gotten to a point where I can comfortably spend a few hours and make a really good looking battlemap for a session, but it always takes me infinitely more time making the map, than making the majority of the content that is necessary in a session. All of this should give me more time and energy to focus on what is important, having fun with my friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect with my friends.&lt;/strong&gt; It is something I am working on over time. There is a lot of people I have drifted away from for no reason at all, and I should really not have. I am making slow steps in the right direction with my IRL friends, but even with my online friends I wish I could do more. This game is a game we play together. I am not just creating a story and letting people play in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="session-5-one-year-from-now"&gt;Session 5: One Year from Now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have read this post in its entirety, thank you for reading to my rambling. I am sure it is a little too aimless for your enjoyment, but it has helped me with internalizing some ideas I have had floating around in my head for a long while. I hope in a year I can look back at this post and see the personal growth I wanted to see from myself. I hope I am still participating in this hobby; I hope I am still writing, and I hope my friends still enjoy the time we spend together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to run a new game, in the fantasy world I am still developing, and take in all the advice im giving to myself right now to heart in that campaign. I want to pour my heart and soul into this project, but then let it be shaped and detailed by the friends I am playing with. I really want a campaign to come to a conclusion, as none of my campaigns have ever really come to a satisfying conclusion yet. I want to experience the gratification of finishing a story, together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to you, Flore, one year from now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have fun.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pantheon of Ae'thar: More Deities, Story, and Culture</title><link>https://www.tabletopflore.com/posts/pantheon-of-aethar-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.tabletopflore.com/posts/pantheon-of-aethar-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So, last post was quite a long one. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a great start to my pantheon already. This article will flesh out the pantheon more by adding minor deities to fill some domains, add the &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMgPgbRb_fA" target="_blank"&gt;one good story&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;, and develop how the culture and actual religion in this world would be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="even-more-deities"&gt;Even More Deities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at my current set of five deities and what domains they represent for clerics, and found out that we&amp;rsquo;re basically covering all of them (some even twice), besides Death, Grave, and Peace. There are also aspects of the world that I&amp;rsquo;d want represented as a deity, like the sky, water, angels, and probably more that I haven&amp;rsquo;t mentioned before. I think the best way to implement these minor deities is to have them act as underlings or servants to the five core deities. For example: I feel like a couple of smaller deities of elements like air, fire, stone, and water fit well underneath Rosaria. A deity of angels would fit under Solana. Likewise, the deity of death and the afterlife could fit neatly beneath Kairos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I want these deities to have their own little corner of the pantheon for themselves. They shouldn&amp;rsquo;t make the Pantheon seem bloated and complex. They should be extra options for clerics and paladins to choose from, while the core five are what I will primarily focus on. I might even steal some deities from my old world, since some minor used ones were quite good on paper. Because I want to make it as simple as possible, I will limit myself to only a maximum of around 3 underlings per core deity, and a minimum of 1. The minimum is in place to make sure every deity has at least one underling. It would feel weird for some to have many while others have none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-minor-deities"&gt;The Minor Deities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deities Aeril, Scylla, Pyrus, and Titanos are the four minor deities of Air, Water, Fire, and Earth, respectively. They were brought to divinity by Rosaria after she became a deity herself. These four deities keep the elemental chaos in check and are often the patron deities of the elementally aligned, like the genasi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charos will be the minor deity of the afterlife, while Daemos will be the minor deity of death. The afterlife and death itself are usually quite the mystery, which is why they will be beneath Kairos. With Kairos also being the god of Fate, it would make sense that death and the afterlife would be under his domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinemo, the minor goddess of Music and Art, and Thena, the minor goddess of Emotion, Compassion, and Grief, will join Veles. I think art in general fits with the domain of Veles quite nicely, while the domain of emotion fits well with the theme of family and civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seranah will be the minor goddess of Angels. She would fall under Solana. Angels are most often associated with light and heaven and whatnot, so it would make sense that Solana would be the one to have her under her wing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Bahamut, minor deity of dragons, would actually fit really well under Lunola. Dragons are, in my opinion, magical creatures in and of themselves. I love dragons in Dungeons and Dragons and will always use them when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="some-thoughts"&gt;Some Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty content with what I have now. I have five core deities that I want to focus most of my attention on, while also having a couple of extra deities that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to flesh out immediately that fill in some space. The total amount of deities is now at 15, which I think is a solid amount. It definitely should not become any more than that. I had the thought that some of these deities, just by their domain, should be powerful themselves. Like, why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t Daemos, the god of death, not be a core deity? But, adding the &amp;lsquo;minor&amp;rsquo; to his title, makes it a non-issue, in my opinion. I&amp;rsquo;m not one to decide on &amp;lsquo;god power levels&amp;rsquo;, but I feel that these minor deities mostly get their power from their respective core deity. &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; have control over these domains, but choose to delegate it to others. Insert workplace comparison here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-one-good-story"&gt;The One Good Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt at making a sort of creation myth for the world that attempts to incorporate the &amp;lsquo;one good story&amp;rsquo; Dael Kingsmill talked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long ago, nothing existed. Only Aleph existed. Aleph created the world of Ae&amp;rsquo;thar. A simple world. Aleph created the Wishgranter, a small building on the world which would grant anyone a wish, if they faced its challenges. The first to make a wish were two sisters. One saw the power in the physical power of mankind, while the other was fascinated by the secrets of the world. Then came a woman that accepted the wilderness for what it is and forgave it for what it could do. After her, a man made a wish. He was a father who valued family and community. The last to make a wish was a man who came alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long after their deaths, Aleph granted them divinity. They became gods of their own personal convictions. This also amplified their convictions, which created conflict. Aleph also granted a few other beings divinity after their wish came true. The deities made changes to the world, influencing people and making them more aligned with their ideals. Once each deity planted their own seed of conviction, Aleph barred the deities from Ae&amp;rsquo;thar, including himself. They were no longer able to influence the world in major ways. Some were furious, some were fine with it. Aleph then went into an eternal slumber.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="more-thoughts"&gt;More Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you might say: “Flore, where&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;lsquo;Authority&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Harbor&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Purpose&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;Treachery?&amp;rsquo;” and to that I would reply: “Yeah, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really able to put that in there.” I think that if you&amp;rsquo;re working out a good simple pantheon from the ground up, this would be a great way to get some core ideas implemented. The problem is that I&amp;rsquo;ve already created my pantheon, and they already represent their own thing. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m generally bad at writing creation myths, but that&amp;rsquo;s another thing. I think this works well enough as a creation story and gives you some idea about how these deities came to be. I&amp;rsquo;m intentionally keeping things vague because this might be an aspect that I want to explore in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-bit-of-culture-and-religion"&gt;A bit of Culture and Religion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, I want to explore some religious practices for Ae&amp;rsquo;thar. I still want to keep it simple and easy to understand, not just for myself, but also for my players. I was thinking of keeping it to maybe some commandments (think of paladin tenets). Chances are I might steal most commandments from deities already existing in D&amp;amp;D, since &amp;lsquo;commandment writing&amp;rsquo; is not my strongsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solana-the-bright-queen"&gt;Solana, the Bright Queen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She represents justice, valor, and retribution. Solana is a deity that represents law and vengeance, so I think she would encourage her followers to follow the laws set by leadership and also those set by yourself. She would also encourage fighting with the strength you have, be brave, and to defend the weak. I think a lot of her commandments mirror that of the paladin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Oath of Vengeance&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her commandments would be something like: - Defend the weak, persecute those that are guilty, and protect the ideals of justice and might. - Bravery above all. There is no glory in cowardice. - Be ever vigilant for evil. People are quick to forget the lessons of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lunola-the-lady-of-magic"&gt;Lunola, the Lady of Magic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She represents discovery, magic, and knowledge. She would definitely encourage finding out the truth in everything, to leave no secrets untouched. Lunola is also the goddess of magic, so expanding your knowledge into the arcane in any way, shape, or form would be encouraged. Not only that, but she also encourages people to forge their own path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her commandments would be: - Seize your own destiny by pursuing your passions. - Follow the echoes of lost magics, forgotten sites, and ancient art, for within these lie the deepest of Ae&amp;rsquo;thar&amp;rsquo;s secrets. - Unmask those who would defy Lunola. Learn their secrets and unveil them to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rosaria-the-red-maiden"&gt;Rosaria, the Red Maiden&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She represents the wilderness, love, and forgiveness, so she would encourage protecting the untamed wilderness from exploitation. Rosaria would also always prefer forgiveness to vengeance. Having mercy and patience is important to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her commandments are: - Protect the untamed wilderness from exploitation and destruction. - Lead with mercy, patience, and compassion. Inspire others to unite in fellowship. - Embrace and respect the savage nature of the world. Exist in harmony with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="veles-the-great-creator"&gt;Veles, the Great Creator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veles is the god of creation, invention, family, and civilization, so upholding the values of family would be a big thing for him. He also encourages everyone to continue innovating and creating new things, not just physical, but cultural as well. He also encourages teamwork and working together with everyone, for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His commandments would be: - Uphold and revere the spirit of invention. Create new settlements, build where inspiration strikes, and expand the edicts of the Law Bearer. - Uphold and promote loyalty to your family, loyalty to your clan, and loyalty to your people. - Utilize the company and aid of others. The efforts of the individual often pale against the capabilities of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kairos-the-mysterious"&gt;Kairos, the Mysterious&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kairos is a god of secrets, shadows, and mystery. He also represents individualism as a theme, so working alone is a big part of his encouragement. He also encourages people to live free, but keep secrets. After all, secrets are what are interesting about a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His commandments are: - Walk unbridled and untethered, forging new memories and experiences. - Learn all you can, and keep hidden that which you know. Reveal what pieces you must, but never the whole. - Seek and exalt places where no light touches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three articles were a lot of fun to write. It might not be a lot of details written down for each deity, but that&amp;rsquo;s not always necessary. I can always create when needed to. Like I said in my first article about pantheons and religion: Its always best to conserve your creative energy for when you need it, instead of expending it all on things you wont use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that, did I do everything I wanted to do? No, there were things I would rather have expanded upon more, but then again, I&amp;rsquo;ll do that when inspiration strikes me, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to force myself to create. Overall, I think this is a great start to my worldbuilding in Ae&amp;rsquo;thar, and I will continue to expand upon the different facets of that world another time. I feel like the Magic: The Gathering system of the five conflicts really work well. It brings a lot more interest to not only the deities themselves, but what the denizens of your world believe in and uphold. As much as I like Dael Kingsmill&amp;rsquo;s system, it clashes with what I already have envisioned, but still works really well on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what my next article is going to be, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see when that comes up. Again, I appreciate every bit of feedback, and I would love to hear your thoughts about this miniseries about religion and pantheons. &amp;lsquo;Til the next article!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pantheon of Ae'thar</title><link>https://www.tabletopflore.com/posts/pantheon-of-aethar/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.tabletopflore.com/posts/pantheon-of-aethar/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Like I said in my last article, this article is going to be me trying to take the (arguably small amount of) knowledge I gained from writing that article and apply that to my new world of &lt;em&gt;Ae&amp;rsquo;thar&lt;/em&gt;. I want to see what kind of system I want to use and what I want to focus on, and maybe work out some cultures and religions as well. As not everyone knows what Ae&amp;rsquo;thar is, I&amp;rsquo;ll start by giving a small introduction to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="quick-intro-to-aethar"&gt;Quick intro to Ae&amp;rsquo;thar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ae&amp;rsquo;thar is a world filled with wonder and fantasy. The world itself is an enormous expanse of ocean, with floating islands in the sky. Skyships are flying over the clouds, going from enormous floating cities to smaller villages on those floating islands. There are ruined civilizations that are either still floating through corrupted and dangerous clouds or have fallen and now lie at the bottom of the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wishgranter"&gt;Wishgranter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing in Ae&amp;rsquo;thar is the &lt;em&gt;Wishgranter&lt;/em&gt;, a colossal building floating above the ocean. It&amp;rsquo;s an extremely challenging dungeon, but grants a wish at the end of it all. The Wishgranter has shaped the world to the way it is through many wishes. Every time someone makes a wish, the building grows larger, teleports away, and returns to a different place a few decades later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="factions-and-politics"&gt;Factions and Politics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many nations in Ae&amp;rsquo;thar want the power of the Wishgranter for themselves, which is why the return of the Wishgranter usually is a spark for war. Each nation and faction that inhabit these skylands have their wishes they want to fulfill, some for selfish reasons, some for the betterment of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="my-view"&gt;My View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My vision for Ae&amp;rsquo;thar is a world that can house many differing campaigns. It could be a political campaign with intrigue and subterfuge. Perhaps it can house a campaign with a lot of exploration, finding the secrets of the world and its ancient civilizations. It could also focus on the Wishgranter itself, which could lead to a very dungeon-heavy campaign. Not only that, but it can also be a mix of these types. With my last world of &lt;em&gt;Eden&lt;/em&gt; being very dark and gloomy, I felt like I wanted to make something more fantasy, with some twists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="designing-the-pantheon"&gt;Designing The Pantheon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve explained a bit of what this world is about: Religions and the Pantheon. I’m going to be using multiple sources to maybe steal from or take inspiration from. I’ll note those when they come up. Furthermore, I’m also writing this article at the same time as creating the pantheon, so if it feels a little like rambling, bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-system"&gt;The System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have explained in the last article, I’m not a big fan of the Loose Pantheon, and I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling like I should go for a duality or a monotheistic world here. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to actually go with a loose pantheon. While I was writing this, I initially wrote a that I wanted to create a tight pantheon. Now that I have finished some aspects of the pantheon though, it looks more and more like a loose pantheon. I&amp;rsquo;ll have a couple of core deities and a few lesser gods to fill the space. I came across this &lt;a href="https://theangrygm.com/conflicted-beliefs/" target="_blank"&gt;great article by the Angry DM&lt;/a&gt; using Magic: The Gathering&amp;rsquo;s system of 5 colors that contrast with each other in such a way that have 2 allies and 2 enemies each, creating a sort of balance that is hard to disturb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMgPgbRb_fA" target="_blank"&gt;great video by Dael Kingsmill&lt;/a&gt; about how she would design a pantheon, which has some interesting insight into where to start with your pantheon. She recommends thinking of four character archetypes in your &amp;lsquo;one good story&amp;rsquo;: Authority, Harbor, Purpose, and Treachery. Highly recommend looking into those two sources. What I&amp;rsquo;m currently thinking of is 5 deities that were made by one overgod-like entity, plus maybe a few lesser deities to fill out the space (if there is any.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="theme-conflicts"&gt;Theme Conflicts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A core part of what the Angry DM described is having 5 different theme conflicts and using those to create your deities. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to start with thinking of those. Two nations I already designed a little before writing this article are the nations of &lt;em&gt;Solari and Lunari&lt;/em&gt;. The Solari Diarchy is a very authoritarian kingdom ruled by a King and Queen, while a council of mages rules the Lunari Dominion. There&amp;rsquo;s some sort of conflict here, like might vs. magic. They don&amp;rsquo;t oppose each other &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much, but it&amp;rsquo;s something of a start. The theme of might is also about believing in the strength, leadership, and power of yourself or your nation. It also includes perseverance through any obstacle. Magic on the other hand also includes mystery, knowledge, and wisdom, to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another nation I designed before writing this article was the nation of Lyonett, of which the capital is an enormous flying airship. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; nation for technological advances and research. Now, I wanted this conflict to be tradition vs. progress, with Lyonett embodying progress, but the conflict didn&amp;rsquo;t really work when I had to think about tradition. It&amp;rsquo;s not particularly a conflict I want to explore within my world, even if it is an interesting conflict in general. I think a conflict that would work here is individualism vs. collectivism. Should each person live for themselves unfettered, or is it better to cooperate and compromise? I envision the people and engineers of Lyonett as selfless people. They research technology and innovate not just for themselves, but for the betterment of everyone around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conflict I think could be interesting to explore is retribution vs. forgiveness. Which is the true nature of justice or the purpose of the law? Vengeance is not always the right choice, but neither is forgiveness. Which side a character might take can give you a lot of information about that character&amp;rsquo;s ideals and worldview. Why they take their stance is also interesting to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to also add some sort of law vs. chaos conflict, but I found that to be too direct. I think civilization vs. wilderness is a better representation of what I would find interesting to explore in my world. Wilderness also does not have the negative connotation chaos does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for less of a philosophical conflict and more one I&amp;rsquo;d love to add: discovery vs. mystery. Part of Dungeons and Dragons is, of course, exploration. The theme of discovery is largely present in it. The world is unexplored and holds many secrets, why not seek those out? On the other hand, there are things that are legend or myth for a reason, the things that should not be explored. The secrets you do not want exposed, either personal or on a worldly scale. Keeping those safe is just as important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll play with these five conflicts: — Might vs. Magic — Individualism vs. Collectivism — Retribution vs. Forgiveness — Civilization vs. Wilderness — Discovery vs. Mystery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-pantheon-itself"&gt;The Pantheon Itself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have my conflicts, It is time to put them together in a way that sort of makes sense. I first thought of the Solari Diarchy and thought that Might and Retribution is a good combination for that nation, and thus their deity. A deity of war, of strength, of justice, and vengeance. It sort of summarizes the Diarchy in a way. They want retribution for what happened to them when the Solari and the Lunari split in two, believing in the strength of man to bring them forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the Lunari believe in Magic and Discovery. They chose to split off from the Lunari some time ago, focusing on their intelligence and magic to keep them safe. This will then be my second deity, a deity of knowledge, of magic, and of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next combination and deity I want to make is the deity of Wilderness and Forgiveness. A deity of nature, of love, of the animals and the weather, of letting go and forgiving. Perhaps it is one of the more self-evident combinations, but it gives more character than a generic nature deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my friends over in the Lyonett, I think Collectivism and Civilization make a great combination. A deity of creation, of tinkering, of working together for a greater good. It exemplifies the ideals of the Lyonett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last combination that is left over is Individualism and Mystery. A deity of secrets, of legends, of myths, and of shadow. On face value, it might seem as the only deity that you could consider as &amp;lsquo;bad&amp;rsquo;. Something to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-actual-gods"&gt;The Actual Gods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solana, the Bright Queen, is the Goddess of Light, Justice, and War. She will represent might and retribution as themes. She is a pillar of justice and honor and is often symbolized by the bright sun in the sky. Generals in the military might align with Solana, and so might those that are not magically aligned as well. Believing in the strength that is inside you and never giving up are the most important commandments she has. A cleric worshiping Solana might take the Light, Order, or War domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunola, the Lady of Magic, is the Goddess of Magic, Discovery, and Knowledge. She represents magic and discovery as themes. She clashes with Solana as she believes that knowledge and magic are what make people strong. All the magic in Ae&amp;rsquo;thar is possible of course thanks to Lunola. She encourages everyone to forge their path in history, and to choose, not be victim to fate. She is often symbolized by the moon in the sky at night, as it changes its phases and is opposite of the Sun. (Usually.) A cleric worshiping Lunola might take the Arcana, Knowledge, or Twilight domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosaria, the Red Maiden, is the Goddess of the Wild, Love, and Nature. She represents wilderness and forgiveness. Symbolized by the red rose, she is beautiful and fragile, yet its thorns cannot be ignored. Her domain is the nature and weather of Ae&amp;rsquo;thar, which is often beautiful but can be dangerous. Kind of like love. (Sorta.) She clashes with Solana as she believes that forgiveness and acceptance is the true way of living and that revenge only breeds hatred. Rosaria believes that leaving the world untouched and letting the wilderness do its thing is better than shaping it to mankind&amp;rsquo;s needs. Live together with nature, not sacrifice it for your own good. A cleric worshiping Rosaria might take the Nature, Life, or Tempest domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veles, the Great Creator, is the God of Creation, Family, and Progress. Representing collectivism and civilization, he encourages creativity and innovation in people, not just for technology or magic, but also for culture and their traditions. He allies himself with Lunola in some ways that he wishes for Ae&amp;rsquo;thar&amp;rsquo;s denizens to continue moving forward. Veles clashes with Rosaria in that Veles sees mankind&amp;rsquo;s work on the land as commendable. It&amp;rsquo;s taking what is there and making it better for everyone. He is often symbolized by a gear. A cleric that worships Veles might take the Forge or Order domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kairos, the Mysterious, is the God of Secrets, Shadows, Mystery, and of Fate. He represents individualism and mystery. Symbolized by the four-pointed star, he represents all that is unknown in the world. The things people don&amp;rsquo;t see, don&amp;rsquo;t hear, and don&amp;rsquo;t speak of. Lunola is often infatuated by the idea of uncovering the secrets Kairos holds. All the while, he encourages people to think for themselves, and keep the secrets they hold so dearly. The world is a dangerous place, you know? While Veles encourages everyone to work together, Kairos knows this only leads to compromise and not the &lt;em&gt;ideal&lt;/em&gt; outcome. A cleric worshiping Kairos might take the Knowledge or Trickery domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleph, the Overgod, is the God of Gods. He created Ae&amp;rsquo;thar and its denizens. He also gave power to these five gods. After his work was done, he went into an eternal sleep. He isn&amp;rsquo;t worshiped outright, but his influence still emanates throughout the world. He is symbolized by a singular closed eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="my-thoughts-so-far"&gt;My Thoughts So Far&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I have a strong start here. The deities conflicting with each other like this creates interesting story opportunities right from the get go. I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with Solana, Lunola, and Rosaria, mostly because I wrote them first and had a good idea for them from the start. Veles is an interesting addition, but I think it works quite well. I originally had two different conflicts: tradition vs. progress and free will vs. fate, but I felt the combination of tradition and fate didn&amp;rsquo;t give me much to work with. Eventually I scrapped that idea and I ended up with what I have now. If I&amp;rsquo;m looking at the cleric subclasses, I am actually missing a couple of domains. I will add a couple smaller, lesser deities to embody some specific aspects of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article has been going on for way too long now, so I&amp;rsquo;ll continue this in a second part later. In that part, I&amp;rsquo;ll create a sort of origin story for the deities and talk about the actual religion around these five deities. I&amp;rsquo;ll also add some lesser deities to the pantheon. I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts so far! &amp;lsquo;Til the next article!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pantheons and Religions</title><link>https://www.tabletopflore.com/posts/pantheons-and-religions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.tabletopflore.com/posts/pantheons-and-religions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As the first article on this blog of mine, I wanted to discuss the role that the deities, religions, and pantheons in your world plays, both in worldbuilding and your tabletop games. I&amp;rsquo;m now figuring out the deities for my world of &lt;em&gt;Ae&amp;rsquo;thar&lt;/em&gt;, and I wanted to share my thoughts about designing them in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="worldbuilding-deities"&gt;Worldbuilding Deities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I use deities and pantheons because I really have to, most TTRPGs kind of expects you to have them in your world. They&amp;rsquo;re a great way to explain the creation myth of your world and exemplify some aspects of your world by making the most forefront deities inhibit those aspects. An example of this in my pantheons would be the deity &lt;em&gt;Lumen&lt;/em&gt; in my abandoned world of &lt;em&gt;Xhoria&lt;/em&gt;. He personified light, order, law, and the sun. Xhoria was a world split between law and chaos, or at least, that&amp;rsquo;s what it was supposed to be. (I abandoned it for a reason.) Many of the civilized nations worshiped Lumen because he personified order and law, in the hope that he would bring stability to the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main choices you make when designing deities is their involvement in the world. Do they answer the call of prayer often, or are they absent from the world? &lt;em&gt;Do they even exist?&lt;/em&gt; (Hey, that&amp;rsquo;s an option as well.) I like the idea of them being not too benevolent, but also not too absent either. The middle ground seems to be fine for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="different-systems"&gt;Different Systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also the distinction between what kind of religious system you want to apply to your world. There are a couple of systems in the DMG, like the Loose Pantheon, which according to the book is: &amp;ldquo;A multitude of deities rule the various aspects of existence, variously cooperating with and competing against one another to administer the affairs of the universe.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t like this type, seems like a lot of work that isn&amp;rsquo;t really relevant to what I need and want for my games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Loose Pantheon, there&amp;rsquo;s also the Tight Pantheon, which &amp;ldquo;focuses on a single religion whose teachings and edicts embrace a small group of deities.&amp;rdquo; I like this one more than the loose one, since it has a lot more structure, while you still can have the inter-deity squabbles you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also the monotheistic and dualism systems, meaning one or two deities respectively. Monotheism always felt a bit… boring to me, personally. Especially in a fantasy setting. Dualism is a lot more interesting, since it has an inherent conflict, which creates drama. Drama is inevitably what I want in my stories and worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="religions"&gt;Religions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when it comes to religions and their ceremonies and rituals, I do not have much experience with that. The designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, and worldviews that are attached to a religion, have always been fairly simple in my worlds. For this, I highly recommend watching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml88aKmJyVM" target="_blank"&gt;Matthew Colville&amp;rsquo;s series&lt;/a&gt; on creating a Pantheon, Religion, and a culture surrounding it. He explains it much better than I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the main takeaway from this is to shape your own deities and religious systems to what you think is relevant to the story or world you want to make, which isn&amp;rsquo;t really the best kind of advice since that&amp;rsquo;s kind of what you&amp;rsquo;re doing with most of your worldbuilding anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="their-use-in-ttrpgs"&gt;Their use in TTRPGs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with TTRPGs is not awfully long, only around 4 years of playing (as of the day that I&amp;rsquo;m writing this), but I&amp;rsquo;ve played D&amp;amp;D5e, had a thorough look at Pathfinder 2e, and dabbled a bit in SWADE. In D&amp;amp;D and in Pathfinder, it&amp;rsquo;s automatically assumed that gods exist and exert influence. Obviously, divine magic has to come from &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;. Now, I love clerics, they&amp;rsquo;re probably my favorite class to play in D&amp;amp;D because of the amount of options they have in and outside of combat. Clerics (and sometimes Paladins) get their powers from the deities, posing as conduits for their god&amp;rsquo;s power and will. I love it if non-clerics also are religious in some aspect, since it can actually give a quick glance into the personality of a character through what deity they worship or at least associate loosely with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="adventures-and-stories"&gt;Adventures and Stories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in most games deities only really come up in medium to high level story arcs, helping the gods beat up an evil god, stopping a very evil god from resurrecting due to a large cult of some kind, stories like that. In lower level situations, you will probably deal more with the people that serve the bad gods than the gods themselves. They&amp;rsquo;re definitely a good source for story and adventure ideas for your players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pantheons, gods and religions are very deeply engrained in most fantasy TTRPGs, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of expected. They&amp;rsquo;re a great source of adventure ideas and stories as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-attempts-at-pantheons"&gt;My Attempts at Pantheons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve had two different worlds with pantheons, working on a third. One has a lot (and I mean a lot) of deities, and one only has two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xhoria"&gt;Xhoria&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my time building Xhoria has been, arguably, wasted on its deities. It contained 100+ deities over multiple pantheons&amp;hellip; of which only a group of twelve were relevant, while taking a lot of my creative energy. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the main reasons I abandoned that world, but I&amp;rsquo;ll write a longer article about that some other day. You can read more about a couple of them on &lt;a href="https://xhoria.miraheze.org/wiki/Pantheons_of_Xhoria" target="_blank"&gt;my wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eden"&gt;Eden&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eden has an interesting system of only two &lt;em&gt;assumed&lt;/em&gt; deities, Lux and Nox, who are both not very friendly towards mankind. They&amp;rsquo;re both responsible for the two big troubles of the City of Lights. Clerics in Eden believe in the domains and not the gods, and get their divine magic from their conviction and dedication to that domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very big spoilers below for my players who play in Eden, or if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="spoiler"&gt;So, between you and me, Lux and Nox do not exist, powerful forces do inhabit the world, like &lt;em&gt;His Radiance&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Twelve Knights of Radiance&lt;/em&gt;, but they’re not considered &lt;em&gt;deities&lt;/em&gt;. Lux and Nox aren’t relevant entities in my story, either, which gives me a little lee-way when it comes to that. This does go against D&amp;amp;D’s assumptions that gods exist and influence the world, I know, but bending those boundaries is just as enjoyable as staying within them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aethar"&gt;Ae&amp;rsquo;thar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to write a separate article on my pantheon for Ae&amp;rsquo;thar, and what my train of thought was designing them. Hopefully you look forward to reading that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="closing-thoughts"&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deities are great, y&amp;rsquo;all. They&amp;rsquo;re great ways to explain things in your world, from a planetary-scale to a small village&amp;rsquo;s culture. They&amp;rsquo;re also great vehicles for story arcs and adventures. While also keeping in mind that you don&amp;rsquo;t go overboard like I did, and keeping them relevant to the story to not overuse your creative juices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also my first article, so I would love to hear your thoughts about it in any way you can. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;m mostly just rambling about things and throwing some of my thoughts on it here and there, but that&amp;rsquo;s what this blog is for, right? I&amp;rsquo;m open to suggestions, criticism and discussion about the things I write. Thank you for reading, and I hope you look forward to my deep-dive into my deities for Ae&amp;rsquo;thar!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
