Quick little post here to let everyone that still reads this blog know that I’m working on a couple different articles right now. Most of them are about how I personally run games or prepare sessions, while others are more about some parts of worldbuilding I love fleshing out in my worlds. I’ve been spending a lot of time lately working on Ae’thar, and it’s been a blast, but I will return to writing articles on this blog soon.","tags":[],"title":"Quick Little Update"},{"categories":["dnd5e","ttrpg","worldbuilding"],"date":"2021-08-04","permalink":"https://www.tabletopflore.com/posts/pantheon-of-aethar-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"So, last post was quite a long one. I think I’ve gotten a great start to my pantheon already. This article will flesh out the pantheon more by adding minor deities to fill some domains, add the ‘one good story’, and develop how the culture and actual religion in this world would be like.\nEven More Deities I looked at my current set of five deities and what domains they represent for clerics, and found out that we’re basically covering all of them (some even twice), besides Death, Grave, and Peace.","tags":["ae'thar","religion"],"title":"Pantheon of Ae'thar: More Deities, Story, and Culture"},{"categories":["dnd5e","ttrpg","worldbuilding"],"date":"2021-07-31","permalink":"https://www.tabletopflore.com/posts/pantheon-of-aethar/","section":"Posts","summary":"Like I said in my last article, this article is going to be me trying to take the (arguably small amount of) knowledge I gained from writing that article and apply that to my new world of Ae’thar.
