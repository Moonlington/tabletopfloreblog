It is uncertain how the world came to be and some parts of history were not recorded or lost to time. The following is the widely regarded creation myth and history of the world.\nThe Chaos of the Cosmos # In the beginning, there was only chaos, a messy cosmological and primordial soup that collided and conflicted with each other. It is believed to have been a universe of anger, rage, hate, and malevolence. Not of emotion, but of pure conflict. The forces that were at play are unknown and impossible to study. This continued until, from either beyond the [[cosmos]] or from within it, certain entities used their power and influence of the chaos to stabilize a part of it. These entities became known as the [[Deities]] of [[Halcyon]]. They collectively carved out a section of the cosmos to begin shaping their vision, and this section would eventually be known as the [[Prime Material Plane]]. While we know now that these entities became our deities, at the dawn of time they were still not fully formed, yet they were young and had ambitions.\nTheir attempt at creating order in the chaos was not overlooked, as quickly the rest of the cosmos fought to preserve their chaos and conflict. These entities fought back, however, and as one they created time and space for themselves, at least for now.\nThe Creation of Man # As the world began to take its shape, the deities created lesser forms to inhabit their created realm. It was [[Titania]] who shaped the [[Elves]] first, who would walk upon the new world and gaze up at the heavenly skies as their creators continued to keep the cosmos at bay. Then, [[Mallus]] took it upon himself to forge the [[Dwarves]], with whom he instilled the same desire to tame the world, to create something. Next was a third race, the [[Humans]], who were instilled with a sense of order by [[Astra]] and curiosity by [[Luna]] to bring meaning to the world. Despite their short lives, they were imbued with ambition, joy, and a sense of purpose.\nAfter these three, the imagination of the deities became limitless. However, while more creations were birthed onto the world, not even the archives of the ancient city of [[Aurora]] could bring light to the origin and identities of other creations.\nThe Gift of Magic # While the deities were protecting their unknowing creations from the hostile force outside of their realm, the creations themselves struggled to survive the harsh and unpredictable environments of an untamed world. They gained knowledge and attempted to build on the land, but even then many lives would be put out by their seemingly uncaring world. In an attempt to aid their creations, the deities gave them a tiny fragment of their power, a sliver of the creation magic that brought mankind to the realm in the first place, to protect and shape the world around them as they deemed appropriate. This was the earliest form of [[Divine Magic]].\nAs the deities bought more time for themselves and their creations, they took it upon themselves to take their creation\u0026rsquo;s form and walk among them.\nAs time went on, more of what we now deem as normal came into existence. [[Astra]] and [[Luna]] gave a sense of rhythm to the world by having the star shine its light upon the lands for half of the day, while the two moons, [[Majora]] and [[Minora]], kept a watchful eye during nightfall.\nThe City of Aurora # The first spark of civilization was in [[Aurora]], the oldest surviving city in [[Halcyon]], where community and preservation grew important as the world around them was still harsh to its people. The city housed a tightly knit community that lived in peace and harmony despite the harsh outside. The city houses the earliest known temples to the deities, and the oldest known records of history, which are widely regarded as the primary source of understanding of the creation of our world. While there are various regional differences in the historical record, the broad strokes of this mythic history are undeniable.\nIt was in this city that mankind began to worship the deities, and it was only then that they were given name and form. The deities that we know now might have been significantly changed through this worship, but it is assumed that even before our world existed, the deities\u0026rsquo; thoughts and emotions were still unique to them, but only reinforced through worship.\nThe Sundering # See also: [[The Sundering]] As mankind and the deities together poured their heart and soul into their realm, the chaos of the cosmos surrounding it only grew in anger and rage. It was only when the heavens began to fall and the world began to fight back in full force that mankind became aware of the wrath that outside forces were capable of. This event in history is called the Sundering.\nPrimal beings spewed forth from the earth and the seas and entities from beyond the heavens came down in an attempt at retaking what was theirs. There was still chaos and strife within the world that the deities created that laid dormant before that now reared its ugly head. This fight between the deities and the chaos fundamentally reshaped the land of [[Halcyon]], shattering its essence - it\u0026rsquo;s [[Aether]] - across the spectrum. What was once an enormous stretch of land only surrounded by water, became an uncountable amount of floating islands and continents, all flying high above the unknowable depths of the [[Great Blue]].\nThe Gift of the Arcane # As the deities and mankind became desperate to save their realm, the deities resorted to extreme measures. [[Luna]] gifted mankind with the ability to create magic on their own, without having to borrow the creation magic from the deities. This gave mankind more freedom and power over the world. The people that had a potency for this new kind of magic called themselves arcanists.\nThis newly given power gave the determined mortals the power to subdue some of the chaos in the realm and gave way for the deities to focus their efforts on the forces outside of the mortals\u0026rsquo; reach.\nAftermath of the Sundering # Eventually, the chaos subsided, but not without loss. Only a tenth of the population survived, and it created a schism in the [[Deities]] about their world. Some wanted to protect it with all of their power, some wanted to return it to the cosmological chaos, as it was deemed a failure to them and too much to bear. This divide in the gods caused chaos and strife within and eventually culminated in the imprisonment of those that sought to bring the world to chaos. They were imprisoned in planes adjacent to the [[Prime Material Plane]], where they would be unable to influence the world. Those that sought to protect their creation became the [[Prime Deities]] of [[Halcyon]], while the others became known as the [[Traitor Gods]].\nAs the realm was now scattered and broken, most of the civilized world had to be rebuilt. [[Aurora]], stood the strongest, and even now is the only known continent that is still rooted in the [[Great Blue]]. The [[Elves]] that primarily inhabited it brought it back to its original glory, until the [[Dwarves]], [[Gnomes]], and [[Humans]] that lived in [[Aurora]] invented technology and magic that would make use of the latent magical essence in the world. This was used in [[Skyship]] technology, a combination of using [[Arcane Magic]] and the natural [[Aether]] of the world to transport yourself through the world.\nGolden age of Halcyon # Together with this new technology and the gift of the arcane, mankind sought to tame and master the new world in front of them, culminating in a golden age of the world. It opened up many possibilities for everyone to harness the world, magic, and its secrets. It is widely known as a long period of technological and magical progress for mankind, where magic users were able to innovate in unprecedented ways, completing difficult tasks with extreme ease. They spawned wondrous, but also dangerous, new forms of life and power.\nThe Cataclysm # See also: [[The Cataclysm]] But this progress also culminated in a deep rot that spread through the world. It exemplified the arrogance and selfishness of mankind. One arcanist became so powerful that they challenged the god of death and fate, and won, taking his place among the gods, and subsequently making sure no one could gain that amount of power ever again. Others became so disillusioned with the gods that they thought themselves to be the true owners of the world. Some went even further, losing sight of the meaning and purpose the world of [[Halcyon]] had to them, and vowing to release the imprisoned gods to bring the world back to its primordial, cosmological, chaotic state.\nOne such powerful arcanist, together with a group of other arcanists, indulged himself in this nihilistic worldview and sought power from the imprisoned gods, succeeding in opening the gates of their prisons. The [[Traitor Gods]] warped their prisons into reflections of their corruption, and their prisons also warped them in diabolical and terrible ways. Their emotions of loss and grief from [[the Sundering]] were twisted into hatred and an urge to dominate and ruin.\nThese newly released gods consolidated their power in secret, and after a while, declared war upon the world and the [[Prime Deities]]. The result was a magical arms race where man and god alike focussed their magical efforts on furthering the war effort.\nThis chaotic war over the future of the realm was seen almost as a second Sundering and became known as [[the Cataclysm]]. While the battles that ensued during the Cataclysm have been lost to time, its presence is ever so evident in the world we see today. Ruins and artifacts from the war tell of unknown battles and stories. It\u0026rsquo;s speculated that only a fifth of the world population survived this event, and for the most part, all traces of the old world were erased from the face of [[Halcyon]], leaving only a few ancient civilizations in well-preserved ruins.\nThe Veiling # See also: [[The Veiling]] The victorious [[Prime Deities]] banished their betraying kin to their respective prison realms, and the world had to recover. The threat still existed, as anyone could be convinced by themselves alone to bring about a second Cataclysm. Another extreme measure was taken by the gods. They created the [[Divine Veil]], barring any god from materializing in the world, and they could only influence the world through their most devout followers. This left mankind to itself, to rebuild civilization, ushering in a new age of mankind.\nAge of Mankind # After the veiling of the world, each different portion of the world began its history. Some turned towards the [[Prime Deities]], some turned to the [[Arcane Magic|arcane]], but every single nation starts its new history, either starting anew or building on top of the ruins of old.\n","date":"9 November 2022","permalink":"/wiki/history-of-halcyon/","section":"Wiki","summary":"The precise origin of [[Halcyon]] is clouded in mystery.

If you wish to elevate the gravity of character death, you can introduce this optional rule.\nIf a character is dead, and a resurrection is attempted by a spell or spell effect with longer than a 1 action casting time, a Resurrection Challenge is initiated. Up to 3 members of the adventuring party can offer to contribute to the ritual via a Contribution Skill Check. The DM asks them each to make a skill check based on their form of contribution, with the DC of the check adjusting to how helpful/impactful the DM feels the contribution would be. For example, praying to the deity of the devout, fallen character may require an Intelligence (Religion) check at an easy to medium difficulty, where loudly demanding the soul of the fallen to return from the aether may require a Charisma (Intimidation) check at a very hard or nearly impossible difficulty. Advantage and disadvantage can apply here based on how perfect, or off base, the contribution offered is.\nAfter all contributions are completed, the DM then rolls a single, final Resurrection success check with no modifier. The base DC for the final resurrection check is 10, increasing by 1 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone (signifying the slow erosion of the soul’s connection to this world). For each successful contribution skill check, this DC is decreased by 3, whereas each failed contribution skill check increases the DC by 1. Upon a successful resurrection check, the player’s soul (should it be willing) will be returned to the body, and the ritual succeeded. On a failed check, the soul does not return and the character is lost.\nOnly the strongest of magical incantations can bypass this resurrection challenge, in the form of the True Resurrection or Wish spells. These spells can also restore a character to life who was lost due to a failed resurrection ritual.\nIf a spell with a casting time of 1 action is used to attempt to restore life (via the Revivify spell or similar effects), no contribution skill checks are allowed. The character casting the spell makes a Rapid Resurrection check, rolling a d20 and adding their spellcasting ability modifier. The DC is 10, increasing by 1 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone. On a failure, the character’s soul is not lost, but the resurrection fails and increases any future Resurrection checks’ DC by 1. No further attempts can be made to restore this character to life until a resurrection spell with a casting time higher than 1 action is attempted.\nBanned Races # There are a few races that are either overpowered or do not fit within the world of [[Halcyon]]. These are as follows.\nAarakocra (Flight is overpowered at lvl 1) Simic Hybrid (\u0026hellip;What even is it?) Vedalken (Overpowered due to adv on saving throws) Yuan-ti Pureblood (Should be fine without Magic Resistance) Variant Human (Given that I\u0026rsquo;m planning on giving everyone a free feat) Bloodied Condition # A character is bloodied when the character\u0026rsquo;s hit points are equal to or less then one-half the character\u0026rsquo;s maximum hit points, rounded down. One-half the character\u0026rsquo;s maximum hit points is referred to as the character\u0026rsquo;s bloodied value. For example: a character with 50 maximum hit points has a bloodied value of 25, and is bloodied whenever the character\u0026rsquo;s hit points are equal to or less than 25. Most of the time this will be used to communicate progress into defeating a monster and will have no impact on gameplay. Some monsters or homebrew classes might have features that activate whenever a character has the bloodied condition.\nBonus Action Healing Potions # Using any healing potion on yourself will cost a bonus action instead of an action. Using any healing potion on someone else will still cost an action.\nCarrying Capacity # If it makes sense for you to carry a thing, you can carry it. You won\u0026rsquo;t be able to carry whole statues, but I do not mind you having a lot of tiny stuff in your inventory. The exception to this is when it\u0026rsquo;s in huge quantities, think a gigantic hoard of gold, or a pile of swords and armor.\nIntense Critical Hits # If you roll a 20 on your attack roll against a creature, instead of either rolling twice the dice or double the amount, you add the maximum amount your dice could roll to your damage. Example: Your attack does 2d6+3 damage, on a crit you add 12 to that roll, which is the maximum of 2d6.\nVariant Rules # Feats # I allow feats. I think it adds a lot of customizability to the game and your character. I\u0026rsquo;m also allowing one single free feat for everyone at level 1. This rule might change.\nInspiration # I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried using inspiration in a game yet, and probably still wont. If I ever decide to use inspiration I will let you know.\nLevel Advancement Without XP # I don\u0026rsquo;t like using XP for leveling because it encourages combat over the other pillars of Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, exploration and social interaction. I, as the DM, decide when the party levels up. This is decided on the amount of adventures and quests the party has completed and their difficulty. All members of the party are the same level\nMore difficult Identification # I like magic items to be a bit more special than normal. You can identify a magic item using the \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;Identify\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; spell as usual, but you can only identify a magic item during a short rest if you succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC determined by the rarity of the magic item.\nMulticlassing # I also allow multiclassing, at least if you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing.\n","date":"24 July 2022","permalink":"/wiki/important-information/","section":"Wiki","summary":"This wiki article explains some of the homebrew rules, variant rules, and other important things to mention about how I personally run my Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons 5th Edition games.\nHouserules # Alternative Resurrection Rules # I use Matthew Mercer\u0026rsquo;s rules for resurrection, which is explained below.","title":"Important Information"},{"content":"It has been an absurdly long while since I posted anything on this site.

So, last post was quite a long one. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten a great start to my pantheon already. This article will flesh out the pantheon more by adding minor deities to fill some domains, add the \u0026lsquo; one good story \u0026rsquo;, and develop how the culture and actual religion in this world would be like.\nEven More Deities # I looked at my current set of five deities and what domains they represent for clerics, and found out that we\u0026rsquo;re basically covering all of them (some even twice), besides Death, Grave, and Peace. There are also aspects of the world that I\u0026rsquo;d want represented as a deity, like the sky, water, angels, and probably more that I haven\u0026rsquo;t mentioned before. I think the best way to implement these minor deities is to have them act as underlings or servants to the five core deities. For example: I feel like a couple of smaller deities of elements like air, fire, stone, and water fit well underneath Rosaria. A deity of angels would fit under Solana. Likewise, the deity of death and the afterlife could fit neatly beneath Kairos.\nNow, I want these deities to have their own little corner of the pantheon for themselves. They shouldn\u0026rsquo;t make the Pantheon seem bloated and complex. They should be extra options for clerics and paladins to choose from, while the core five are what I will primarily focus on. I might even steal some deities from my old world, since some minor used ones were quite good on paper. Because I want to make it as simple as possible, I will limit myself to only a maximum of around 3 underlings per core deity, and a minimum of 1. The minimum is in place to make sure every deity has at least one underling. It would feel weird for some to have many while others have none.\nThe Minor Deities # The deities Aeril, Scylla, Pyrus, and Titanos are the four minor deities of Air, Water, Fire, and Earth, respectively. They were brought to divinity by Rosaria after she became a deity herself. These four deities keep the elemental chaos in check and are often the patron deities of the elementally aligned, like the genasi.\nCharos will be the minor deity of the afterlife, while Daemos will be the minor deity of death. The afterlife and death itself are usually quite the mystery, which is why they will be beneath Kairos. With Kairos also being the god of Fate, it would make sense that death and the afterlife would be under his domain.\nSinemo, the minor goddess of Music and Art, and Thena, the minor goddess of Emotion, Compassion, and Grief, will join Veles. I think art in general fits with the domain of Veles quite nicely, while the domain of emotion fits well with the theme of family and civilization.\nSeranah will be the minor goddess of Angels. She would fall under Solana. Angels are most often associated with light and heaven and whatnot, so it would make sense that Solana would be the one to have her under her wing.\nI think Bahamut, minor deity of dragons, would actually fit really well under Lunola. Dragons are, in my opinion, magical creatures in and of themselves. I love dragons in Dungeons and Dragons and will always use them when possible.\nSome Thoughts # I\u0026rsquo;m pretty content with what I have now. I have five core deities that I want to focus most of my attention on, while also having a couple of extra deities that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to flesh out immediately that fill in some space. The total amount of deities is now at 15, which I think is a solid amount. It definitely should not become any more than that. I had the thought that some of these deities, just by their domain, should be powerful themselves. Like, why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t Daemos, the god of death, not be a core deity? But, adding the \u0026lsquo;minor\u0026rsquo; to his title, makes it a non-issue, in my opinion. I\u0026rsquo;m not one to decide on \u0026lsquo;god power levels\u0026rsquo;, but I feel that these minor deities mostly get their power from their respective core deity. They have control over these domains, but choose to delegate it to others. Insert workplace comparison here.\nThe One Good Story # So, here\u0026rsquo;s my attempt at making a sort of creation myth for the world that attempts to incorporate the \u0026lsquo;one good story\u0026rsquo; Dael Kingsmill talked about.\nLong ago, nothing existed. Only Aleph existed. Aleph created the world of Ae\u0026rsquo;thar. A simple world. Aleph created the Wishgranter, a small building on the world which would grant anyone a wish, if they faced its challenges. The first to make a wish were two sisters. One saw the power in the physical power of mankind, while the other was fascinated by the secrets of the world. Then came a woman that accepted the wilderness for what it is and forgave it for what it could do. After her, a man made a wish. He was a father who valued family and community. The last to make a wish was a man who came alone.\nLong after their deaths, Aleph granted them divinity. They became gods of their own personal convictions. This also amplified their convictions, which created conflict. Aleph also granted a few other beings divinity after their wish came true. The deities made changes to the world, influencing people and making them more aligned with their ideals. Once each deity planted their own seed of conviction, Aleph barred the deities from Ae\u0026rsquo;thar, including himself. They were no longer able to influence the world in major ways. Some were furious, some were fine with it. Aleph then went into an eternal slumber.\nMore Thoughts # Now, you might say: “Flore, where\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026lsquo;Authority\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Harbor\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Purpose\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;Treachery?\u0026rsquo;” and to that I would reply: “Yeah, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really able to put that in there.” I think that if you\u0026rsquo;re working out a good simple pantheon from the ground up, this would be a great way to get some core ideas implemented. The problem is that I\u0026rsquo;ve already created my pantheon, and they already represent their own thing. Also, I\u0026rsquo;m generally bad at writing creation myths, but that\u0026rsquo;s another thing. I think this works well enough as a creation story and gives you some idea about how these deities came to be. I\u0026rsquo;m intentionally keeping things vague because this might be an aspect that I want to explore in the game.\nA bit of Culture and Religion # In this section, I want to explore some religious practices for Ae\u0026rsquo;thar. I still want to keep it simple and easy to understand, not just for myself, but also for my players. I was thinking of keeping it to maybe some commandments (think of paladin tenets). Chances are I might steal most commandments from deities already existing in D\u0026amp;D, since \u0026lsquo;commandment writing\u0026rsquo; is not my strongsuit.\nSolana, the Bright Queen # She represents justice, valor, and retribution. Solana is a deity that represents law and vengeance, so I think she would encourage her followers to follow the laws set by leadership and also those set by yourself. She would also encourage fighting with the strength you have, be brave, and to defend the weak. I think a lot of her commandments mirror that of the paladin\u0026rsquo;s Oath of Vengeance.\nHer commandments would be something like: - Defend the weak, persecute those that are guilty, and protect the ideals of justice and might. - Bravery above all. There is no glory in cowardice. - Be ever vigilant for evil. People are quick to forget the lessons of the past.\nLunola, the Lady of Magic # She represents discovery, magic, and knowledge. She would definitely encourage finding out the truth in everything, to leave no secrets untouched. Lunola is also the goddess of magic, so expanding your knowledge into the arcane in any way, shape, or form would be encouraged. Not only that, but she also encourages people to forge their own path.\nHer commandments would be: - Seize your own destiny by pursuing your passions. - Follow the echoes of lost magics, forgotten sites, and ancient art, for within these lie the deepest of Ae\u0026rsquo;thar\u0026rsquo;s secrets. - Unmask those who would defy Lunola. Learn their secrets and unveil them to the world.\nRosaria, the Red Maiden # She represents the wilderness, love, and forgiveness, so she would encourage protecting the untamed wilderness from exploitation. Rosaria would also always prefer forgiveness to vengeance. Having mercy and patience is important to her.\nHer commandments are: - Protect the untamed wilderness from exploitation and destruction. - Lead with mercy, patience, and compassion. Inspire others to unite in fellowship. - Embrace and respect the savage nature of the world. Exist in harmony with it.\nVeles, the Great Creator # Veles is the god of creation, invention, family, and civilization, so upholding the values of family would be a big thing for him. He also encourages everyone to continue innovating and creating new things, not just physical, but cultural as well. He also encourages teamwork and working together with everyone, for everyone.\nHis commandments would be: - Uphold and revere the spirit of invention. Create new settlements, build where inspiration strikes, and expand the edicts of the Law Bearer. - Uphold and promote loyalty to your family, loyalty to your clan, and loyalty to your people. - Utilize the company and aid of others. The efforts of the individual often pale against the capabilities of the community.\nKairos, the Mysterious # Kairos is a god of secrets, shadows, and mystery. He also represents individualism as a theme, so working alone is a big part of his encouragement. He also encourages people to live free, but keep secrets. After all, secrets are what are interesting about a person.\nHis commandments are: - Walk unbridled and untethered, forging new memories and experiences. - Learn all you can, and keep hidden that which you know. Reveal what pieces you must, but never the whole. - Seek and exalt places where no light touches.\nFinal Thoughts # These three articles were a lot of fun to write. It might not be a lot of details written down for each deity, but that\u0026rsquo;s not always necessary. I can always create when needed to. Like I said in my first article about pantheons and religion: Its always best to conserve your creative energy for when you need it, instead of expending it all on things you wont use.\nBesides that, did I do everything I wanted to do? No, there were things I would rather have expanded upon more, but then again, I\u0026rsquo;ll do that when inspiration strikes me, so that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to force myself to create. Overall, I think this is a great start to my worldbuilding in Ae\u0026rsquo;thar, and I will continue to expand upon the different facets of that world another time. I feel like the Magic: The Gathering system of the five conflicts really work well. It brings a lot more interest to not only the deities themselves, but what the denizens of your world believe in and uphold. As much as I like Dael Kingsmill\u0026rsquo;s system, it clashes with what I already have envisioned, but still works really well on its own.\nI have no idea what my next article is going to be, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see when that comes up. Again, I appreciate every bit of feedback, and I would love to hear your thoughts about this miniseries about religion and pantheons. \u0026lsquo;Til the next article!\n","date":"4 August 2021","permalink":"/posts/pantheon-of-aethar-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"Ae\u0026rsquo;thar has been renamed to Halcyon in newer articles. So, last post was quite a long one. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten a great start to my pantheon already. This article will flesh out the pantheon more by adding minor deities to fill some domains, add the \u0026lsquo; one good story \u0026rsquo;, and develop how the culture and actual religion in this world would be like.","title":"Pantheon of Ae'thar: More Deities, Story, and Culture"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2021","permalink":"/tags/religion/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"religion"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2021","permalink":"/categories/ttrpg/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"ttrpg"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2021","permalink":"/categories/worldbuilding/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"worldbuilding"},{"content":" Ae\u0026rsquo;thar has been renamed to Halcyon in newer articles. Like I said in my last article, this article is going to be me trying to take the (arguably small amount of) knowledge I gained from writing that article and apply that to my new world of Ae\u0026rsquo;thar. I want to see what kind of system I want to use and what I want to focus on, and maybe work out some cultures and religions as well. As not everyone knows what Ae\u0026rsquo;thar is, I\u0026rsquo;ll start by giving a small introduction to the world.\nQuick intro to Ae\u0026rsquo;thar # Ae\u0026rsquo;thar is a world filled with wonder and fantasy. The world itself is an enormous expanse of ocean, with floating islands in the sky. Skyships are flying over the clouds, going from enormous floating cities to smaller villages on those floating islands. There are ruined civilizations that are either still floating through corrupted and dangerous clouds or have fallen and now lie at the bottom of the ocean.\nWishgranter # The most interesting thing in Ae\u0026rsquo;thar is the Wishgranter, a colossal building floating above the ocean. It\u0026rsquo;s an extremely challenging dungeon, but grants a wish at the end of it all. The Wishgranter has shaped the world to the way it is through many wishes. Every time someone makes a wish, the building grows larger, teleports away, and returns to a different place a few decades later.\nFactions and Politics # Many nations in Ae\u0026rsquo;thar want the power of the Wishgranter for themselves, which is why the return of the Wishgranter usually is a spark for war. Each nation and faction that inhabit these skylands have their wishes they want to fulfill, some for selfish reasons, some for the betterment of the world.\nMy View # My vision for Ae\u0026rsquo;thar is a world that can house many differing campaigns. It could be a political campaign with intrigue and subterfuge. Perhaps it can house a campaign with a lot of exploration, finding the secrets of the world and its ancient civilizations. It could also focus on the Wishgranter itself, which could lead to a very dungeon-heavy campaign. Not only that, but it can also be a mix of these types. With my last world of Eden being very dark and gloomy, I felt like I wanted to make something more fantasy, with some twists.\nDesigning The Pantheon # Now that I’ve explained a bit of what this world is about: Religions and the Pantheon. I’m going to be using multiple sources to maybe steal from or take inspiration from. I’ll note those when they come up. Furthermore, I’m also writing this article at the same time as creating the pantheon, so if it feels a little like rambling, bear with me.\nThe System # As I have explained in the last article, I’m not a big fan of the Loose Pantheon, and I\u0026rsquo;m not feeling like I should go for a duality or a monotheistic world here. I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to actually go with a loose pantheon. While I was writing this, I initially wrote a that I wanted to create a tight pantheon. Now that I have finished some aspects of the pantheon though, it looks more and more like a loose pantheon. I\u0026rsquo;ll have a couple of core deities and a few lesser gods to fill the space. I came across this great article by the Angry DM using Magic: The Gathering\u0026rsquo;s system of 5 colors that contrast with each other in such a way that have 2 allies and 2 enemies each, creating a sort of balance that is hard to disturb.\nThere is also this great video by Dael Kingsmill about how she would design a pantheon, which has some interesting insight into where to start with your pantheon. She recommends thinking of four character archetypes in your \u0026lsquo;one good story\u0026rsquo;: Authority, Harbor, Purpose, and Treachery. Highly recommend looking into those two sources. What I\u0026rsquo;m currently thinking of is 5 deities that were made by one overgod-like entity, plus maybe a few lesser deities to fill out the space (if there is any.)\nTheme Conflicts # A core part of what the Angry DM described is having 5 different theme conflicts and using those to create your deities. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to start with thinking of those. Two nations I already designed a little before writing this article are the nations of Solari and Lunari. The Solari Diarchy is a very authoritarian kingdom ruled by a King and Queen, while a council of mages rules the Lunari Dominion. There\u0026rsquo;s some sort of conflict here, like might vs. magic. They don\u0026rsquo;t oppose each other that much, but it\u0026rsquo;s something of a start. The theme of might is also about believing in the strength, leadership, and power of yourself or your nation. It also includes perseverance through any obstacle. Magic on the other hand also includes mystery, knowledge, and wisdom, to some extent.\nAnother nation I designed before writing this article was the nation of Lyonett, of which the capital is an enormous flying airship. It\u0026rsquo;s the nation for technological advances and research. Now, I wanted this conflict to be tradition vs. progress, with Lyonett embodying progress, but the conflict didn\u0026rsquo;t really work when I had to think about tradition. It\u0026rsquo;s not particularly a conflict I want to explore within my world, even if it is an interesting conflict in general. I think a conflict that would work here is individualism vs. collectivism. Should each person live for themselves unfettered, or is it better to cooperate and compromise? I envision the people and engineers of Lyonett as selfless people. They research technology and innovate not just for themselves, but for the betterment of everyone around them.\nA conflict I think could be interesting to explore is retribution vs. forgiveness. Which is the true nature of justice or the purpose of the law? Vengeance is not always the right choice, but neither is forgiveness. Which side a character might take can give you a lot of information about that character\u0026rsquo;s ideals and worldview. Why they take their stance is also interesting to think about.\nI wanted to also add some sort of law vs. chaos conflict, but I found that to be too direct. I think civilization vs. wilderness is a better representation of what I would find interesting to explore in my world. Wilderness also does not have the negative connotation chaos does.\nNow for less of a philosophical conflict and more one I\u0026rsquo;d love to add: discovery vs. mystery. Part of Dungeons and Dragons is, of course, exploration. The theme of discovery is largely present in it. The world is unexplored and holds many secrets, why not seek those out? On the other hand, there are things that are legend or myth for a reason, the things that should not be explored. The secrets you do not want exposed, either personal or on a worldly scale. Keeping those safe is just as important.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll play with these five conflicts: — Might vs. Magic — Individualism vs. Collectivism — Retribution vs. Forgiveness — Civilization vs. Wilderness — Discovery vs. Mystery\nThe Pantheon Itself # Now that I have my conflicts, It is time to put them together in a way that sort of makes sense. I first thought of the Solari Diarchy and thought that Might and Retribution is a good combination for that nation, and thus their deity. A deity of war, of strength, of justice, and vengeance. It sort of summarizes the Diarchy in a way. They want retribution for what happened to them when the Solari and the Lunari split in two, believing in the strength of man to bring them forward.\nOn the other hand, the Lunari believe in Magic and Discovery. They chose to split off from the Lunari some time ago, focusing on their intelligence and magic to keep them safe. This will then be my second deity, a deity of knowledge, of magic, and of discovery.\nThe next combination and deity I want to make is the deity of Wilderness and Forgiveness. A deity of nature, of love, of the animals and the weather, of letting go and forgiving. Perhaps it is one of the more self-evident combinations, but it gives more character than a generic nature deity.\nFor my friends over in the Lyonett, I think Collectivism and Civilization make a great combination. A deity of creation, of tinkering, of working together for a greater good. It exemplifies the ideals of the Lyonett.\nThe last combination that is left over is Individualism and Mystery. A deity of secrets, of legends, of myths, and of shadow. On face value, it might seem as the only deity that you could consider as \u0026lsquo;bad\u0026rsquo;. Something to think about.\nThe Actual Gods # Solana, the Bright Queen, is the Goddess of Light, Justice, and War. She will represent might and retribution as themes. She is a pillar of justice and honor and is often symbolized by the bright sun in the sky. Generals in the military might align with Solana, and so might those that are not magically aligned as well. Believing in the strength that is inside you and never giving up are the most important commandments she has. A cleric worshiping Solana might take the Light, Order, or War domain.\nLunola, the Lady of Magic, is the Goddess of Magic, Discovery, and Knowledge. She represents magic and discovery as themes. She clashes with Solana as she believes that knowledge and magic are what make people strong. All the magic in Ae\u0026rsquo;thar is possible of course thanks to Lunola. She encourages everyone to forge their path in history, and to choose, not be victim to fate. She is often symbolized by the moon in the sky at night, as it changes its phases and is opposite of the Sun. (Usually.) A cleric worshiping Lunola might take the Arcana, Knowledge, or Twilight domain.\nRosaria, the Red Maiden, is the Goddess of the Wild, Love, and Nature. She represents wilderness and forgiveness. Symbolized by the red rose, she is beautiful and fragile, yet its thorns cannot be ignored. Her domain is the nature and weather of Ae\u0026rsquo;thar, which is often beautiful but can be dangerous. Kind of like love. (Sorta.) She clashes with Solana as she believes that forgiveness and acceptance is the true way of living and that revenge only breeds hatred. Rosaria believes that leaving the world untouched and letting the wilderness do its thing is better than shaping it to mankind\u0026rsquo;s needs. Live together with nature, not sacrifice it for your own good. A cleric worshiping Rosaria might take the Nature, Life, or Tempest domain.\nVeles, the Great Creator, is the God of Creation, Family, and Progress. Representing collectivism and civilization, he encourages creativity and innovation in people, not just for technology or magic, but also for culture and their traditions. He allies himself with Lunola in some ways that he wishes for Ae\u0026rsquo;thar\u0026rsquo;s denizens to continue moving forward. Veles clashes with Rosaria in that Veles sees mankind\u0026rsquo;s work on the land as commendable. It\u0026rsquo;s taking what is there and making it better for everyone. He is often symbolized by a gear. A cleric that worships Veles might take the Forge or Order domain.\nKairos, the Mysterious, is the God of Secrets, Shadows, Mystery, and of Fate. He represents individualism and mystery. Symbolized by the four-pointed star, he represents all that is unknown in the world. The things people don\u0026rsquo;t see, don\u0026rsquo;t hear, and don\u0026rsquo;t speak of. Lunola is often infatuated by the idea of uncovering the secrets Kairos holds. All the while, he encourages people to think for themselves, and keep the secrets they hold so dearly. The world is a dangerous place, you know? While Veles encourages everyone to work together, Kairos knows this only leads to compromise and not the ideal outcome. A cleric worshiping Kairos might take the Knowledge or Trickery domain.\nAleph, the Overgod, is the God of Gods. He created Ae\u0026rsquo;thar and its denizens. He also gave power to these five gods. After his work was done, he went into an eternal sleep. He isn\u0026rsquo;t worshiped outright, but his influence still emanates throughout the world. He is symbolized by a singular closed eye.\nMy Thoughts So Far # I think I have a strong start here. The deities conflicting with each other like this creates interesting story opportunities right from the get go. I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with Solana, Lunola, and Rosaria, mostly because I wrote them first and had a good idea for them from the start. Veles is an interesting addition, but I think it works quite well. I originally had two different conflicts: tradition vs. progress and free will vs. fate, but I felt the combination of tradition and fate didn\u0026rsquo;t give me much to work with. Eventually I scrapped that idea and I ended up with what I have now. If I\u0026rsquo;m looking at the cleric subclasses, I am actually missing a couple of domains. I will add a couple smaller, lesser deities to embody some specific aspects of the world.\nThis article has been going on for way too long now, so I\u0026rsquo;ll continue this in a second part later. In that part, I\u0026rsquo;ll create a sort of origin story for the deities and talk about the actual religion around these five deities. I\u0026rsquo;ll also add some lesser deities to the pantheon. I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts so far! \u0026lsquo;Til the next article!\n","date":"31 July 2021","permalink":"/posts/pantheon-of-aethar/","section":"Posts","summary":"Ae\u0026rsquo;thar has been renamed to Halcyon in newer articles.

I\u0026rsquo;m now figuring out the deities for my world of Ae\u0026rsquo;thar, and I wanted to share my thoughts about designing them in this article.\nWorldbuilding Deities # Personally, I use deities and pantheons because I really have to, most TTRPGs kind of expects you to have them in your world. They\u0026rsquo;re a great way to explain the creation myth of your world and exemplify some aspects of your world by making the most forefront deities inhibit those aspects. An example of this in my pantheons would be the deity Lumen in my abandoned world of Xhoria. He personified light, order, law, and the sun. Xhoria was a world split between law and chaos, or at least, that\u0026rsquo;s what it was supposed to be. (I abandoned it for a reason.) Many of the civilized nations worshiped Lumen because he personified order and law, in the hope that he would bring stability to the nation.\nOne of the main choices you make when designing deities is their involvement in the world. Do they answer the call of prayer often, or are they absent from the world? Do they even exist? (Hey, that\u0026rsquo;s an option as well.) I like the idea of them being not too benevolent, but also not too absent either. The middle ground seems to be fine for me.\nDifferent Systems # There\u0026rsquo;s also the distinction between what kind of religious system you want to apply to your world. There are a couple of systems in the DMG, like the Loose Pantheon, which according to the book is: \u0026ldquo;A multitude of deities rule the various aspects of existence, variously cooperating with and competing against one another to administer the affairs of the universe.\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t like this type, seems like a lot of work that isn\u0026rsquo;t really relevant to what I need and want for my games.\nIn contrast to the Loose Pantheon, there\u0026rsquo;s also the Tight Pantheon, which \u0026ldquo;focuses on a single religion whose teachings and edicts embrace a small group of deities.\u0026rdquo; I like this one more than the loose one, since it has a lot more structure, while you still can have the inter-deity squabbles you want.\nThere are also the monotheistic and dualism systems, meaning one or two deities respectively. Monotheism always felt a bit… boring to me, personally. Especially in a fantasy setting. Dualism is a lot more interesting, since it has an inherent conflict, which creates drama. Drama is inevitably what I want in my stories and worlds.\nReligions # So when it comes to religions and their ceremonies and rituals, I do not have much experience with that. The designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, and worldviews that are attached to a religion, have always been fairly simple in my worlds. For this, I highly recommend watching Matthew Colville\u0026rsquo;s series on creating a Pantheon, Religion, and a culture surrounding it. He explains it much better than I could.\nI think the main takeaway from this is to shape your own deities and religious systems to what you think is relevant to the story or world you want to make, which isn\u0026rsquo;t really the best kind of advice since that\u0026rsquo;s kind of what you\u0026rsquo;re doing with most of your worldbuilding anyway.\nTheir use in TTRPGs # My experience with TTRPGs is not awfully long, only around 4 years of playing (as of the day that I\u0026rsquo;m writing this), but I\u0026rsquo;ve played D\u0026amp;D5e, had a thorough look at Pathfinder 2e, and dabbled a bit in SWADE. In D\u0026amp;D and in Pathfinder, it\u0026rsquo;s automatically assumed that gods exist and exert influence. Obviously, divine magic has to come from somewhere. Now, I love clerics, they\u0026rsquo;re probably my favorite class to play in D\u0026amp;D because of the amount of options they have in and outside of combat. Clerics (and sometimes Paladins) get their powers from the deities, posing as conduits for their god\u0026rsquo;s power and will. I love it if non-clerics also are religious in some aspect, since it can actually give a quick glance into the personality of a character through what deity they worship or at least associate loosely with.\nAdventures and Stories # I think in most games deities only really come up in medium to high level story arcs, helping the gods beat up an evil god, stopping a very evil god from resurrecting due to a large cult of some kind, stories like that. In lower level situations, you will probably deal more with the people that serve the bad gods than the gods themselves. They\u0026rsquo;re definitely a good source for story and adventure ideas for your players.\nPantheons, gods and religions are very deeply engrained in most fantasy TTRPGs, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of expected. They\u0026rsquo;re a great source of adventure ideas and stories as well.\nMy Attempts at Pantheons # So I\u0026rsquo;ve had two different worlds with pantheons, working on a third. One has a lot (and I mean a lot) of deities, and one only has two.\nXhoria # A lot of my time building Xhoria has been, arguably, wasted on its deities. It contained 100+ deities over multiple pantheons\u0026hellip; of which only a group of twelve were relevant, while taking a lot of my creative energy. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the main reasons I abandoned that world, but I\u0026rsquo;ll write a longer article about that some other day. You can read more about a couple of them on my wiki .\nEden # Eden has an interesting system of only two assumed deities, Lux and Nox, who are both not very friendly towards mankind. They\u0026rsquo;re both responsible for the two big troubles of the City of Lights. Clerics in Eden believe in the domains and not the gods, and get their divine magic from their conviction and dedication to that domain.\nVery big spoilers below for my players who play in Eden, or if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to know.\nSo, between you and me, Lux and Nox do not exist, powerful forces do inhabit the world, like His Radiance and the Twelve Knights of Radiance, but they\u0026rsquo;re not considered deities. Lux and Nox aren\u0026rsquo;t relevant entities in my story, either, which gives me a little lee-way when it comes to that. This does go against D\u0026amp;D\u0026rsquo;s assumptions that gods exist and influence the world, I know, but bending those boundaries is just as enjoyable as staying within them. Ae\u0026rsquo;thar # Ae\u0026rsquo;thar has been renamed to Halcyon in newer articles. I am going to write a separate article on my pantheon for Ae\u0026rsquo;thar, and what my train of thought was designing them. Hopefully you look forward to reading that!\nClosing thoughts # Deities are great, y\u0026rsquo;all. They\u0026rsquo;re great ways to explain things in your world, from a planetary-scale to a small village\u0026rsquo;s culture. They\u0026rsquo;re also great vehicles for story arcs and adventures. While also keeping in mind that you don\u0026rsquo;t go overboard like I did, and keeping them relevant to the story to not overuse your creative juices.\nThis is also my first article, so I would love to hear your thoughts about it in any way you can. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I\u0026rsquo;m mostly just rambling about things and throwing some of my thoughts on it here and there, but that\u0026rsquo;s what this blog is for, right? I\u0026rsquo;m open to suggestions, criticism and discussion about the things I write. Thank you for reading, and I hope you look forward to my deep-dive into my deities for Ae\u0026rsquo;thar!\n","date":"17 July 2021","permalink":"/posts/pantheons-and-religions/","section":"Posts","summary":"As the first article on this blog of mine, I wanted to discuss the role that the deities, religions, and pantheons in your world plays, both in worldbuilding and your tabletop games.","title":"Pantheons and Religions"},{"content":"","date":"17 July 2021","permalink":"/tags/xhoria/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"xhoria"},{"content":"Hello!
